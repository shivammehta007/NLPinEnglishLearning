the normans (norman: nourmands; french: normands; latin: normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy, a region in france.
the normans (norman: nourmands; french: normands; latin: normanni) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy, a region in france.
they were descended from norse ("norman" comes from "norseman") raiders and pirates from denmark, iceland and norway who, under their leader rollo, agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia.
they were descended from norse ("norman" comes from "norseman") raiders and pirates from denmark, iceland and norway who, under their leader rollo, agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia.
the distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.
norman adventurers founded the kingdom of sicily under roger ii after conquering southern italy on the saracens and byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, william the conqueror, led to the norman conquest of england at the battle of hastings in 1066.
the duchy of normandy, which they formed by treaty with the french crown, was a great fief of medieval france, and under richard i of normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.
the normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their christian piety, becoming exponents of the catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated.
the english name "normans" comes from the french words normans/normanz, plural of normant, modern french normand, which is itself borrowed from old low franconian nortmann "northman" or directly from old norse norðmaðr, latinized variously as nortmannus, normannus, or nordmannus (recorded in medieval latin, 9th century) to mean "norseman, viking".

the duchy of normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte between king charles iii of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo, and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria.
the duchy of normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte between king charles iii of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo, and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria.
the treaty offered rollo and his men the french lands between the river epte and the atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further viking incursions. the area corresponded to the northern part of present-day upper normandy down to the river seine, but the duchy would eventually extend west beyond the seine.
before rollo's arrival, its populations did not differ from picardy or the île-de-france, which were considered "frankish".
the descendants of rollo's vikings and their frankish wives would replace the norse religion and old norse language with catholicism (christianity) and the gallo-romance language of the local people, blending their maternal frankish heritage with old norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique "norman" culture in the north of france.

most norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation.
soon after the normans began to enter italy, they entered the byzantine empire and then armenia, fighting against the pechenegs, the bulgars, and especially the seljuk turks.
one of the first norman mercenaries to serve as a byzantine general was hervé in the 1050s.
in the 1060s, robert crispin led the normans of edessa against the turks. they were based at malatya and edessa, under the byzantine duke of antioch, isaac komnenos.
roussel de bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in asia minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the byzantine general alexius komnenos.
they even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: afranji, meaning "franks."
a norman named oursel led a force of "franks" into the upper euphrates valley in northern syria.
some normans joined turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the armenians vassal-states of sassoun and taron in far eastern anatolia.
several families of byzantine greece were of norman mercenary origin during the period of the comnenian restoration, when byzantine emperors were seeking out western european warriors. the raoulii were descended from an italo-norman named raoul, the petraliphae were descended from a pierre d'aulps, and that group of albanian clans known as the maniakates were descended from normans who served under george maniaces in the sicilian expedition of 1038.
robert guiscard, an other norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of apulia as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the byzantines out of southern italy.
the city's garrison resisted until february 1082, when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there.
after allying himself with croatia and the catholic cities of dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of albania, capturing valona, kanina, jericho (orikumi), and reaching butrint after numerous pillages.
meanwhile, they occupied petrela, the citadel of mili at the banks of the river deabolis, gllavenica (ballsh), kanina and jericho. the lack of supplies, disease and byzantine resistance forced bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the byzantines in the city of deabolis.
a few years after the first crusade, in 1107, the normans under the command of bohemond, robert's son, landed in valona and besieged dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail.

the further decline of byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials.
some time later, dyrrachium—one of the most important naval bases of the adriatic—fell again to byzantine hands. the further decline of byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium, owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials.

the normans had a profound effect on irish culture and history after their invasion at bannow bay in 1169.
the normans settled mostly in an area in the east of ireland, later known as the pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including trim castle and dublin castle.
the normans had a profound effect on irish culture and history after their invasion at bannow bay in 1169. yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became "more irish than the irish themselves."
king malcolm iii of scotland married edgar's sister margaret, and came into opposition to william who had already disputed scotland's southern borders. one of the claimants of the english throne opposing william the conqueror, edgar atheling, eventually fled to scotland.

william invaded scotland in 1072, riding as far as abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships.
malcolm submitted, paid homage to william and surrendered his son duncan as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the scottish crown owed allegiance to the king of england.

even before the norman conquest of england, the normans had come into contact with wales.
these normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of wales was at some point subject to norman interference.

after the successful siege of antioch in 1097, bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city.
in 1096, crusaders passing by the siege of amalfi were joined by bohemond of taranto and his nephew tancred with an army of italo-normans.
tancred was instrumental in the conquest of jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the crusader kingdom in transjordan and the region of galilee.[citation needed]
the conquest of cyprus by the anglo-norman forces of the third crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under western european domination for the following 380 years.
but a storm dispersed the fleet.
after some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship.
in april 1191 richard the lion-hearted left messina with a large fleet in order to reach acre.
he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure. survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island's despot isaac komnenos.
all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat.
isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons.
richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by guy de lusignan. various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time, in particular guy de lusignan.
between 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the norman noble jean de bethencourt and the poitevine gadifer de la salle conquered the canarian islands of lanzarote, fuerteventura and el hierro off the atlantic coast of africa.
bethencourt took the title of king of the canary islands, as vassal to henry iii of castile.

the customary law of normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of jersey and guernsey in the channel islands.
norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues: these are the très ancien coutumier (very ancient customary), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the grand coutumier de normandie (great customary of normandy, originally summa de legibus normanniae in curia laïcali), authored between 1235 and 1245.
they spread a unique romanesque idiom to england and italy, and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north french style fundamentally altered the military landscape.
their style was characterised by rounded arches, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.
in england, the period of norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the anglo-saxon and precedes the early gothic.

in southern italy, the normans incorporated elements of islamic, lombard, and byzantine building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as norman-arab architecture within the kingdom of sicily.
however, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts.

the french wars of religion in the 16th century and french revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this norman creativity.
by far the most famous work of norman art is the bayeux tapestry, which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery.

it was commissioned by odo, the bishop of bayeux and first earl of kent, employing natives from kent who were learned in the nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the danish vikings.
many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in norman italy and drew heavily on the greek heritage.
normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century.
at fécamp, under two italian abbots, william of volpiano and john of ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught.

computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.
a problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used.
the theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage.

other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing).
one of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.
closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory.
a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory.

in turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically. closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory.

the input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. in computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved.
in contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. in computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved.
stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input. a computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance.

to further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of germany's 15 largest cities?
the quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in milan whose total length is at most 10 km.
for this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.
when considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet.
usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings.

decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory.
a decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0.

a decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. a decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no.
a decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. if the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.
the input is an arbitrary graph.
the problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected, or not. the formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs—of course, to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

a function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem, that is, it isn't just yes or no.

a function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem, that is, it isn't just yes or no.
it is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. however, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems.
deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers. for example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a, b, c) such that the relation a × b = c holds.
to measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem.
thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. however, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance.
thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance.
this is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits.
complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size.
if the input size is n, the time taken can be expressed as a function of n. since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity t(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n. if t(n) is a polynomial in n, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm.

a turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine.
it is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a turing machine that solves the problem.
since turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.
it is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape.
a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.

a probabilistic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.
algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. a non-deterministic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state.
algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms.
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic turing machines, probabilistic turing machines, non-deterministic turing machines, quantum turing machines, symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines.
they are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic turing machines, probabilistic turing machines, non-deterministic turing machines, quantum turing machines, symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines.
many machine models different from the standard multi-tape turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines.
perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power.
the time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.
what all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.
for example, a non-deterministic turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once.
however, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources.
the non-deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.
the non-deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.
the time required by a deterministic turing machine m on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" or "no").
since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria.
for instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic turing machine is then denoted by dtime(f(n)).
for a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic turing machine is used. a decision problem a can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem.
although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource.

to classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem.
analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms.
to classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. however, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem.
to show an upper bound t(n) on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most t(n). to classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem.
however, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. the phrase "all possible algorithms" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future.
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation, which hides constant factors and smaller terms.
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation, which hides constant factors and smaller terms.
for instance, if t(n) = 7n2 + 15n + 40, in big o notation one would write t(n) = o(n2).
this makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used.
of course, some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework.

but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.
for instance, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape turing machines.

if we allow polynomial variations in running time, cobham-edmonds thesis states that "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" (goldreich 2008, chapter 1.2).
this forms the basis for the complexity class p, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic turing machine within polynomial time.

classes like ip and am are defined using interactive proof systems.
for the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems.
in particular, although dtime(n) is contained in dtime(n2), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict.
for time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively.
they are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources.
having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.
the time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes.
for instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace.
for instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace.
many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction.
a reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem.
for instance, if a problem x can be solved using an algorithm for y, x is no more difficult than y, and we say that x reduces to y. there are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as cook reductions, karp reductions and levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.

the most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction.
for example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers.
this means that the reduction process takes polynomial time.
indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.
indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.
a problem x is hard for a class of problems c if every problem in c can be reduced to x. thus no problem in c is harder than x, since an algorithm for x allows us to solve any problem in c. of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used.

in particular, the set of problems that are hard for np is the set of np-hard problems.
if a problem x is in c and hard for c, then x is said to be complete for c. this means that x is the hardest problem in c. (since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that x is one of the hardest problems in c.) thus the class of np-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in np, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in p. because the problem p = np is not solved, being able to reduce a known np-complete problem, π2, to another problem, π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for π1.

the complexity class p is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm.
this hypothesis is called the cobham–edmonds thesis.
the complexity class np, on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the boolean satisfiability problem, the hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem.

since deterministic turing machines are special non-deterministic turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in p is also member of the class np.
if the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions.
these include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems.
there is a us$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.
it was shown by ladner that if p ≠ np then there exist problems in np that are neither in p nor np-complete.
such problems are called np-intermediate problems.
the graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be np-intermediate.
the graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.
the answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not np-complete. an important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in p, np-complete, or np-intermediate.
if graph isomorphism is np-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level.
if graph isomorphism is np-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level.
the best algorithm for this problem, due to laszlo babai and eugene luks has run time 2o(√(n log(n))) for graphs with n vertices.
the integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer.
phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the rsa algorithm.

many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved.
for instance p ⊆ np ⊆ pp ⊆ pspace, but it is possible that p = pspace.
since there are many known complexity classes between p and pspace, such as rp, bpp, pp, bqp, ma, ph, etc.,
it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class.
along the same lines, co-np is the class containing the complement problems (i.e. problems with the yes/no answers reversed) of np problems.

it has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then p is not equal to np. it is believed that np is not equal to co-np; however, it has not yet been proven.
it has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then p is not equal to np.
similarly, it is not known if l (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in p or equal to p. again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as nl and nc, and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

problems that can be solved in theory (e.g., given large but finite time), but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful, are known as intractable problems.
to see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting.
if np is not the same as p, then the np-complete problems are also intractable in this sense.
for example, the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases.

before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers.
most influential among these was the definition of turing machines by alan turing in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.

the rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously.
utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used.

this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson, joy and walschaerts motions. in the 1840s and 50s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff.
this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson, joy and walschaerts motions.
the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred.

steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.

steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means.

with two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other (quartered).
when the double expansion group is duplicated, producing a 4-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180°, the groups being set at 90° to each other.

in most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port.
the complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events – admission, expansion, exhaust, compression.

the quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas, while exhausting in cold areas.
uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where, during each stroke, the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam, whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature.
the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction.
an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder.
instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting (trunnion).
these engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.[citation needed]

the working fluid in a rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an "open loop" system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied.

the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid.
without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °c (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °c.

by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced.
to derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume.
the main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines.
in marine service, (pioneered on the turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines.

it is named after william john macquorn rankine, a scottish polymath.
the historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its "duty".
the concept of duty was first introduced by watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier newcomen designs.
duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal.
the best examples of newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million.
watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17.

these were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications.
thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.

a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly.
evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler.
evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than "once-through" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]

as a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.
the governor could not actually hold a set speed, because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes.
the adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated.

most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually "shortening the cutoff" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period.
however, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression ("kick back").[citation needed]

typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (rpm) in the usa with 60 hertz power, 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems.
the weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.
for mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors.
however, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power.

they were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam.
steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe.
such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler.
the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.
the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.
early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine.

when corliss was given the rumford medal the committee said that "no one invention since watt's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine".
in addition to using 30% less steam, it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off, making it well suited to manufacturing, especially cotton spinning.
the steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam.

by condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle.
gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °c.

the rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the ts diagram begins to resemble the carnot cycle.

oxygen condenses at 90.20 k (−182.95 °c, −297.31 °f), and freezes at 54.36 k (−218.79 °c, −361.82 °f).
both liquid and solid o 2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light).
high-purity liquid o 2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air.
liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air, using liquid nitrogen as a coolant.
it is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.
free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies.
the increased solubility of o 2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content.
the increased solubility of o 2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content.
scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of o 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration.
water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o 2 in eutrophic water bodies.
free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in earth's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago.
free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago).
for the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations.
when such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7 billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7 billion years ago.

a similar method is the electrocatalytic o 2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids.
chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. a similar method is the electrocatalytic o 2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids.
oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports.
oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports.
professional athletes, especially in american football, also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a "boost" in performance.
available studies support a performance boost from enriched o 2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise.
the pharmacological effect is doubtful; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation.
hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o 2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff.
increased o 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin.
oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them.
oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood.
uptake of o 2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration, so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine.
uptake of o 2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration, so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine. treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart.
oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen. treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart.

for example, the mineral feo (wüstite) is written as fe 1 − xo, where x is usually around 0.05.
the surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion.

people who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental o 2 supplies.[h] passengers traveling in (pressurized) commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of o 2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization.
sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop.
a steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.

oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds.
for reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °c (68 °f).

oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.
such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas.
there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, thf, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, dmf, dmso, acetic acid, and formic acid.
among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "r" is an organic group): alcohols (r-oh); ethers (r-o-r); ketones (r-co-r); aldehydes (r-co-h); carboxylic acids (r-cooh); esters (r-coo-r); acid anhydrides (r-co-o-co-r); and amides (r-c(o)-nr 2). there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, thf, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, dmf, dmso, acetic acid, and formic acid.
acetone ((ch 3) 2co) and phenol (c 6h 5oh) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances.
other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide.

the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.
only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and the carotenes, contain no oxygen. the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.
of the organic compounds with biological relevance, carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen.
all fats, fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen (due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues).
oxygen also occurs in phosphate (po3− 4) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules atp and adp, in the backbone and the purines (except adenine) and pyrimidines of rna and dna, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.
oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving.
prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o 2 partial pressure more than 60 kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis.
exposure to a o 2 partial pressures greater than 160 kpa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers).
acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% o 2 at 66 m or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% o 2 at only 6 m. exposure to a o 2 partial pressures greater than 160 kpa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers).

breathing pure o 2 in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as apollo, causes no damage due to the low total pressures used.
in the case of spacesuits, the o 2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30 kpa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting o 2 partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level o 2 partial pressure (for more information on this, see space suit and arterial blood gas).

the 1973 oil crisis began in october 1973 when the members of the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries (oapec, consisting of the arab members of opec plus egypt and syria) proclaimed an oil embargo.
by the end of the embargo in march 1974, the price of oil had risen from us$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; us prices were significantly higher.
it was later called the "first oil shock", followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the "second oil shock."

some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott.
to address this, the nixon administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants.
by january 18, 1974, us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula.
the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974.
on august 15, 1971, the united states unilaterally pulled out of the bretton woods accord.
the us abandoned the gold exchange standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to "float" (rise and fall according to market demand).
anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before.
in september 1971, opec issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold. because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased.
the result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased.
from 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year.
this contributed to the "oil shock". after 1971, opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation. the substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.
the substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.
until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. from 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year.
on october 6, 1973, syria and egypt, with support from other arab nations, launched a surprise attack on israel, on yom kippur.
at the time, iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally.
you've [western nations] increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement... you buy our crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid us... it's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil. let's say ten times more."
at the time, iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally. weeks later, the shah of iran said in an interview: "of course [the price of oil] is going to rise... certainly!
at the time, iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally. this renewal of hostilities in the arab–israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices.
in response to american aid to israel, on october 16, 1973, opec raised the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel.

in response to american aid to israel, on october 16, 1973, opec raised the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel. the following day, oil ministers agreed to the embargo, a cut in production by five percent from september's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met.
on october 19, nixon requested congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid to israel, including $1.5 billion in outright grants.
at their kuwait meeting, oapec proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the us as a "principal hostile country". in response to american aid to israel, on october 16, 1973, opec raised the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel. on october 19, nixon requested congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid to israel, including $1.5 billion in outright grants.
saudi arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of islam, known as wahhabism, throughout the world, via religious charities such al-haramain foundation, which often also distributed funds to violent sunni extremist groups such as al-qaeda and the taliban.

much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the middle east.
some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking western demand.

in the us production, distribution and price disruptions "have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth."
the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil.
in the united states, scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973.
further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissinger's dominance.
the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to u.s. energy security.
on an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles.

the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the arctic.
finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production.
of the nine members of the european economic community (eec), the netherlands faced a complete embargo, the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies (having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks.

the energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels.
there is criticism that american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities.
instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.
in 2004, declassified documents revealed that the u.s. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late 1973.
although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between u.s. secretary of defense james schlesinger and british ambassador to the united states lord cromer revealed schlesinger had told him that "it was no longer obvious to him that the u.s. could not use force."
although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned "the american occupation would need to last 10 years as the west developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world."

it received a 5% production cut in december, causing a panic. on november 7, 1973, the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a "nonfriendly" country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy.
on november 22, japan issued a statement "asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories, advocating palestinian self-determination, and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions".
by december 25, japan was considered an arab-friendly state.

another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran, a non-arabic but largely shiite muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution. in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich al-hasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year.

the crisis reduced the demand for large cars.
japanese imports, primarily the toyota corona, the toyota corolla, the datsun b210, the datsun 510, the honda civic, the mitsubishi galant (a captive import from chrysler sold as the dodge colt), the subaru dl, and later the honda accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical american v8 and six cylinder engines. the crisis reduced the demand for large cars.

compact trucks were introduced, such as the toyota hilux and the datsun truck, followed by the mazda truck (sold as the ford courier), and the isuzu-built chevrolet luv.
mitsubishi rebranded its forte as the dodge d-50 a few years after the oil crisis.
mazda, mitsubishi and isuzu had joint partnerships with ford, chrysler, and gm, respectively.
later the american makers introduced their domestic replacements (ford ranger, dodge dakota and the chevrolet s10/gmc s-15), ending their captive import policy.
an increase in imported cars into north america forced general motors, ford and chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales.
the dodge omni / plymouth horizon from chrysler, the ford fiesta and the chevrolet chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s.
by 1985, the average american vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon, compared to 13.5 in 1970.
the cadillac deville and fleetwood, buick electra, oldsmobile 98, lincoln continental, mercury marquis, and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s.
the only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the chevrolet bel air, and ford galaxie 500.
by 1979, virtually all "full-size" american cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions.
chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 (except for the m-body dodge diplomat/plymouth gran fury and chrysler new yorker fifth avenue sedans).
federal safety standards, such as nhtsa federal motor vehicle safety standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 mustang i were a prelude to the dot "downsize" revision of vehicle categories.
opec soon lost its preeminent position, and in 1981, its production was surpassed by that of other countries.
the world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel.
saudi arabia, trying to recover market share, increased production, pushing prices down, shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers.

the legislature of the european union is principally composed of the european parliament and the council of the european union, which under the treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the treaties.
the three sources of european union law are primary law, secondary law and supplementary law.
european union law is applied by the courts of member states and the court of justice of the european union.
where the laws of member states provide for lesser rights european union law can be enforced by the courts of member states.
in case of european union law which should have been transposed into the laws of member states, such as directives, the european commission can take proceedings against the member state under the treaty on the functioning of the european union.
supplementary sources of european union law include case law by the court of justice, international law and general principles of european union law.

the eu's primary constitutional sources are the treaty on european union (teu) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu), which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states.
the treaties establish the eu's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the eu can legislate with directives or regulations.
during the ordinary legislative procedure, the council (which are ministers from member state governments) and the european parliament (elected by citizens) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass.
it appoints the commissioners and the board of the european central bank.
the commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce eu law.
the primary law of the eu consists mainly of the founding treaties, the "core" treaties being the treaty on european union (teu) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu).
the teu specifically excludes certain regions, for example the faroe islands, from the jurisdiction of european union law.
the teu provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.[vague] all eu member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the teu, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the teu objectives. the court of justice of the european union can interpret the treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law.
individuals may rely on primary law in the court of justice of the european union if the treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional.
the teu specifically excludes certain regions, for example the faroe islands, from the jurisdiction of european union law. treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period.
the primary law of the eu consists mainly of the founding treaties, the "core" treaties being the treaty on european union (teu) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu).
european union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example gibraltar and the åland islands.

the principal treaties that form the european union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the treaty of rome 1957 and the maastricht treaty 1992 (now: tfeu).

since its establishment, more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties, from the uk, ireland, denmark and norway in 1972 (though norway did not end up joining), greece in 1979, spain and portugal 1985, austria, finland, norway and sweden in 1994 (though again norway failed to join, because of lack of support in the referendum), the czech republic, cyprus, estonia, hungary, latvia, lithuania, malta, poland, slovakia and slovenia in 2004, romania and bulgaria in 2007 and croatia in 2013.

major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single, internal market in the single european act 1986, to further the development of a more social europe in the treaty of amsterdam 1997, and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the eu institutions in the treaty of nice 2001 and the treaty of lisbon 2007.

greenland signed a treaty in 1985 giving it a special status.
however, as a result of the referendum in france and the referendum in the netherlands, the 2004 treaty establishing a constitution for europe never came into force. following the nice treaty, there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the european union and make it more transparent; this would have also produced a single constitutional document.

its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty, but it was formally an amending treaty, and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them.

the european commission is the main executive body of the european union.
this means that the commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the council is the "de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives". the european commission is the main executive body of the european union.
the parliament can also formally request the commission to submit a legislative proposal but the commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons.
decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a "written procedure" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] since ireland refused to consent to changes in the treaty of lisbon 2007, there remains one commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the president and the high representative for foreign and security policy (currently federica mogherini).

article 17(1) of the treaty on european union states the commission should "promote the general interest of the union" while article 17(3) adds that commissioners should be "completely independent" and not "take instructions from any government".

this means commissioners are, through the appointment process, the unelected subordinates of member state governments.
commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the santer commission was censured by parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations.
this resulted in one main case, commission v edith cresson where the european court of justice held that a commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law.
by contrast to the ecj's relaxed approach, a committee of independent experts found that a culture had developed where few commissioners had ‘even the slightest sense of responsibility’.
it has a six-person board appointed by the european council, on the council's recommendation.
the president of the council and a commissioner can sit in on ecb meetings, but do not have voting rights.

this led to the creation of the european anti-fraud office.
in 2012 it investigated the maltese commissioner for health, john dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a tobacco products directive.
the second main legislative body is the council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states.
it meets each six months and its president (currently former poland prime minister donald tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'.
when voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states.
in total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus.
teu article 16(4) and tfeu article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the eu: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.

the essence is there are three readings, starting with a commission proposal, where the parliament must vote by a majority of all meps (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block commission amendment.

this means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in parliament, a minority in the council, and a majority in the commission: it is harder to change eu law than stay the same.
the eu as a whole can only act within its power set out in the treaties.
many member state courts believe they decide, other member state parliaments believe they decide, while within the eu, the court of justice believes it has the final say.
to make new legislation, tfeu article 294 defines the "ordinary legislative procedure" that applies for most eu acts.

where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a "conciliation committee" is convened, representing meps, ministers and the commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the parliament and council to approve by absolute and qualified majority.
the judicial branch of the eu has played an important role in the development of eu law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration.
today the court of justice of the european union (cjeu) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher european court of justice (commonly abbreviated as ecj) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a general court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance.
under the treaty on european union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to "possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices" (or for the general court, the "ability required for appointment to high judicial office").
in fact, most eu law is applied by member state courts (the english court of appeal, the german bundesgerichtshof, the belgian cour du travail, etc.)
the cjeu's duty is to "ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate.

within the eu itself, the court of justice's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law, then eu law has primacy.
the italian constitutional court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, costa had no claim.
similarly, in amministrazione delle finanze v simmenthal spa, a company, simmenthal spa, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an italian law of 1970 for importing beef from france to italy was contrary to two regulations from 1964 and 1968.
this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems.
in the first major case in 1964, costa v enel, a milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations.
he claimed the italian nationalisation law conflicted with the treaty of rome, and requested a reference be made to both the italian constitutional court and the court of justice under tfeu article 267. by contrast, the court of justice held that ultimately the treaty of rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the treaty provisions only the commission could have brought a claim, not mr costa.
generally speaking, while all member states recognise that eu law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the treaties, they do not accept that the court of justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights.

it was held in r (factortame ltd) v secretary of state for transport that "whatever limitation of its sovereignty parliament accepted when it enacted the european communities act 1972 was entirely voluntary" and so "it has always been clear" that uk courts have a duty "to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of community law." more recently the uk supreme court noted that in r (hs2 action alliance ltd) v secretary of state for transport, although the uk constitution is uncodified, there could be "fundamental principles" of common law, and parliament "did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation" of those principles when it enacted the european communities act 1972.
the view of the german constitutional court from the solange i and solange ii decisions is that if the eu does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override german law.
this suggests the eu's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.
while constitutional law concerns the european union's governance structure, administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law.
however, under directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties.
these rules on "direct effect" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer eu law.
while constitutional law concerns the european union's governance structure, administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law.
in van gend en loos v nederlandse administratie der belastingen it was held that the provisions of the treaties (and eu regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require eu or national authorities to take further action to implement them.
because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, van gend en loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. van gend en loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now tfeu article 30 prevented the dutch customs authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from germany to the netherlands.

because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, van gend en loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. eu regulations are the same as treaty provisions in this sense, because as tfeu article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all member states’.
while the treaties and regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), directives do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens.
for example, the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law.
for example, the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law.
this view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three advocate generals persuasively argued that directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.
first, if a directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the directive in such an action (so called "vertical" direct effect).

ms kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for swedex gmbh & co kg before her dismissal.
in foster v british gas plc the court of justice held that mrs foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, british gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

fourth, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law "as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive".
in marleasing sa v la comercial sa the court of justice held that a spanish court had to interpret its general civil code provisions, on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors, to conform with the first company law directive article 11, that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons.
so, in francovich v italy, the italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the insolvency protection directive required.
francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million lira from the italian government in damages for his loss.
the principles of european union law are rules of law which have been developed by the european court of justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how european union law is interpreted and applies.
accepted general principles of european union law include fundamental rights (see human rights), proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law and subsidiarity.
proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1950s.
the principle of proportionality is also recognised in article 5 of the ec treaty, stating that "any action by the community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this treaty". according to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued.
when there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted, and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued.
the concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1960s.
it is an important general principle of international law and public law, which predates european union law.
the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the european union must have a proper legal basis.
the doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in european union law.
as such the european court of justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states.
therefore, the european court of justice cannot uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states.
none of the original treaties establishing the european union mention protection for fundamental rights.
at the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights, hence the establishment of the european convention on human rights in 1950 and the establishment of the european court of human rights.

in 1999 the european council set up a body tasked with drafting a european charter of human rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the european union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the european union and its institutions.
the 2007 lisbon treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in article 6(1) that "the union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union of 7 december 2000, as adopted at strasbourg on 12 december 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the treaties."

in effect, after the lisbon treaty, the charter and the convention now co-exist under european union law, though the former is enforced by the european court of justice in relation to european union measures, and the latter by the european court of human rights in relation to measures by member states.

the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law.
the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law.
the basis for the social chapter was developed in 1989 by the "social partners" representatives, namely unice, the employers' confederation, the european trade union confederation (etuc) and ceep, the european centre of public enterprises.
the social charter declares 30 general principles, including on fair remuneration of employment, health and safety at work, rights of disabled and elderly, the rights of workers, on vocational training and improvements of living conditions.
the social charter became the basis for european community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation.
the social charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states.
the uk refused to sign the social charter and was exempt from the legislation covering social charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation. the social charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states.
the uk subsequently was the only member state to veto the social charter being included as the "social chapter" of the 1992 maastricht treaty - instead, an agreement on social policy was added as a protocol.

following the election of the uk labour party to government in 1997, the uk formally subscribed to the agreement on social policy, which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the social chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam.

in 1957 competition rules were included in the treaty of rome, also known as the ec treaty, which established the european economic community (eec).
today, the treaty of lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in article 101(1), including price fixing.
article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing.
the general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of eu member states) might significantly impede effective competition.
article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing.
while the concept of a "social market economy" was only introduced into eu law in 2007, free movement and trade were central to european development since the treaty of rome 1957.

like in other regional organisations such as the north american free trade association, or the world trade organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices.
the treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.
increasingly the court of justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.
free movement of goods within the european union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination.
it discriminated against parallel importers like mr dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in france, where they bought the scotch.
it also means states can be responsible for private actors.
for instance, in commission v france french farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of spanish strawberries, and even belgian tomato imports.
so, in schmidberger v austria the court of justice held that austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the a13, brenner autobahn, en route to italy.
in the most famous case rewe-zentral ag v bundesmonopol für branntwein, the court of justice found that a german law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to tfeu article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports.
german liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but cassis de dijon, which rewe-zentrale ag wished to import from france, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol.
in a 2003 case, commission v italy italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate".
all italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but british, danish and irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats.
so, in a 2009 case, commission v italy, the court of justice held that an italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.
in keck and mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a french competition law, which prevented them selling picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful.
the aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade.
in konsumentombudsmannen v de agostini the court of justice reviewed swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products.
under the unfair commercial practices directive, the eu harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair.
since its foundation, the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement.
reflecting the economic nature of the project, the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a "factor of production".
free movement was increasingly based on "citizenship", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights.
for example, in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie, a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions.
the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an "indirect quid pro quo" for the work he did.
the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers.
in a famous case, the belgian football association v bosman, a belgian footballer named jean-marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from r.f.c. de liège to usl dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether dunkerque could afford to pay liège the habitual transfer fees.
in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate.
in hendrix v employee insurance institute the court of justice held that a dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to belgium, because the benefit was "closely linked to the socio-economic situation" of the netherlands.
conversely, in geven v land nordrhein-westfalen the court of justice held that a dutch woman living in the netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in germany, did not have a right to receive german child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in germany but was resident in austria could.
citizenship of the eu has increasingly been seen as a "fundamental" status of member state nationals by the court of justice, and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move.

in commission v austria the court held that austria was not entitled to restrict places in austrian universities to austrian students to avoid "structural, staffing and financial problems" if (mainly german) foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem.
the court has required that higher education, along with other forms of vocational training, should be more access, albeit with qualifying periods.
as well as creating rights for "workers" who generally lack bargaining power in the market, the treaty on the functioning of the european union also protects the "freedom of establishment" in article 49, and "freedom to provide services" in article 56.
in gebhard v consiglio dell’ordine degli avvocati e procuratori di milano the court of justice held that to be "established" means to participate in economic life "on a stable and continuous basis", while providing "services" meant pursuing activity more "on a temporary basis". however, the requirements to be registered in milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, "justified by imperative requirements in the general interest" and proportionately applied.
in reyners v belgium the court of justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the belgian bar because he lacked belgian nationality was unjustified.
tfeu article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise "official authority", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. in reyners v belgium the court of justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the belgian bar because he lacked belgian nationality was unjustified.
by contrast in commission v italy the court of justice held that a requirement for lawyers in italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction.
in 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of côte d'ivoire, from a european ship, prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste.
with countries such as spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, franco frattini, the justice, freedom and security commissioner, proposed with dimas to create criminal sentences for "ecological crimes". in 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of côte d'ivoire, from a european ship, prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste.
however, in october 2007, the court of justice ruled that the commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be, only that there must be some.
the competence for the union to do this was contested in 2005 at the court of justice resulting in a victory for the commission.
the "freedom to provide services" under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services "for remuneration", especially commercial or professional activity.
for example, in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice.
the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.
the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the german health clinic) to provide services.
this meant the daily mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the uk. in regard to companies, the court of justice held in r (daily mail and general trust plc) v hm treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing tfeu article 49.
uk law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent.
uk law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent.
the court of justice held that denmark's minimum capital law infringed centros ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the uk could admittedly provide services in denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an "outright negation" of the right of establishment.
similarly in überseering bv v nordic construction gmbh the court of justice held that a german court could not deny a dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in germany.
the amazon rainforest (portuguese: floresta amazônica or amazônia; spanish: selva amazónica, amazonía or usually amazonia; french: forêt amazonienne; dutch: amazoneregenwoud), also known in english as amazonia or the amazon jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the amazon basin of south america.
this basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.

following the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.
from 66–34 mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45°.
during the oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.
during the oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. it expanded again during the middle miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum.
however, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species. it expanded again during the middle miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum.

during the mid-eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch.
water on the eastern side flowed toward the atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the pacific across the amazonas basin. during the mid-eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch.
as the andes mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the solimões basin.
within the last 5–10 million years, this accumulating water broke through the purus arch, joining the easterly flow toward the atlantic. as the andes mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the solimões basin.

there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum (lgm) and subsequent deglaciation.
analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.
some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today.

nasa's calipso satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the sahara to the amazon: an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the sahara each year, at 15 degrees west longitude, across 1,600 miles (2,600 km) over the atlantic ocean (some dust falls into the atlantic), then at 35 degrees west longitude at the eastern coast of south america, 27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the amazon basin, 132 million tons of dust remain in the air, 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the caribbean sea, past 75 degrees west longitude.

archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book amazonia: man and culture in a counterfeit paradise.
she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.
she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.
however, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated.
some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at marajó, and inland dwellers.
for a long time, it was thought that the amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil.

by 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.
the first european to travel the length of the amazon river was francisco de orellana in 1542.
the bbc's unnatural histories presents evidence that orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the amazon in the 1540s.
it is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from europe, such as smallpox.

the bbc's unnatural histories presented evidence that the amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.
terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest, is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management.
terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest, is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management.
the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.
in the region of the xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida.

various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh.
there are also numerous parasites and disease vectors.
deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas.
prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact.
farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method.
however, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion.
deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.
between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle.

currently, brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the united states.
seventy percent of formerly forested land in the amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture.
the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon.
the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation.
the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 (22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year) was 18% higher than in the previous five years (19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year).

although deforestation has declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014, there has been an increase to the present day.
environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.

as indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide, such as in the peruvian amazon indigenous peoples' rainforest communities continue to disappear, while others, like the urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories.
meanwhile, the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland south american peoples has gained increased attention, as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts.

the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar (sar) and thematic mapper (tm) to accurately place the different portions of the amazon into one of the four classifications.
in 2005, parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years, and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought.
a july 23, 2006 article in the uk newspaper the independent reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought.
scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a "tipping point" where it would irreversibly start to die.

it concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate.
in 2010 the amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought.
the affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles (3,000,000 km2) of rainforest, compared to 734,000 square miles (1,900,000 km2) in 2005.
the 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off, whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part.

their most distinctive feature is the ‘combs’ – groups of cilia which they use for swimming – they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia.
some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.
adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size.

only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named.
the textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey.
in favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day.
the phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth.

most species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate.
some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time.
some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times.
fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch.
the combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.

the exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.
the later accidental introduction of beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as beroe preys on other ctenophores.
one ctenophore, mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the black sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish.

ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. in bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains.

despite their soft, gelatinous bodies, fossils thought to represent ctenophores, apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms, have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early cambrian, about 515 million years ago. a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the "cydippids" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.

ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.),
ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.
and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals).

unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs.
and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals).
like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer.
hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer.

most species have eight strips, called comb rows, that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia, called "ctenes," stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat, those of each comb touch the comb below.
the name "ctenophora" means "comb-bearing", from the greek κτείς (stem-form κτεν-) meaning "comb" and the greek suffix -φορος meaning "carrying".
at least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid pleurobrachia.
in addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study.
coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study.
hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – pleurobrachia, beroe and mnemiopsis.
the inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis.
the nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ cells that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence.
the internal cavity forms: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals.

these branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores.
the outer surface bears usually eight comb rows, called swimming-plates, which are used for swimming.
the "combs" (also called "ctenes" or "comb plates") run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to 2 millimeters (0.079 in).
unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function.
hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing, unlike jellyfish.

it is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities.
if they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking.
if they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking.
conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density. if they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking.
the largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth).

the statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia.
its main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called "balancers", that sense its orientation.

cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded, sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped; the common coastal "sea gooseberry," pleurobrachia, sometimes has an egg-shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end, although some individuals are more uniformly round.
from opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long, slender tentacles, each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn.

the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches.
colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.
the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed.
euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey.

there are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body.

there are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body.
from each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows, and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows.
the lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth.
between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth.

this combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.
members of the lobate genera bathocyroe and ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly.

unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids.

the beroida, also known as nuda, have no feeding appendages, but their large pharynx, just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body, bears "macrocilia" at the oral end.

in front of the field of macrocilia, on the mouth "lips" in some species of beroe, is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that "zip" the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding, by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip.

these fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to "bite" off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores. the beroida, also known as nuda, have no feeding appendages, but their large pharynx, just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body, bears "macrocilia" at the oral end.
the cestida ("belt animals") are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals, with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon.
the cestida ("belt animals") are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals, with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon.
cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows.
there are two known species, with worldwide distribution in warm, and warm-temperate waters: cestum veneris ("venus' girdle") is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long, and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly.

most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction, with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface.
they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular "foot".
all but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows.
platyctenids are usually cryptically colored, live on rocks, algae, or the body surfaces of other invertebrates, and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches, seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current.
the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis.
fertilization is external in most species, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch.
self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.

in the genus beroe the juveniles, like the adults, lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths.
in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to the sea-floor.

almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic.
members of the genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts.

members of the cydippid genus pleurobrachia and the lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.
the two-tentacled "cydippid" lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow.
ctenophores used to be regarded as "dead ends" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals.
detailed investigation of chum salmon, oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around.
beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores.
this is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the red sea.
some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations.
on the other hand, in the late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish.

mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis-eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.
the ediacaran eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.
three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-cambrian period.
until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early devonian (emsian) period.
all three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species.
the early cambrian sessile frond-like fossil stromatoveris, from china's chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago, is very similar to vendobionta of the preceding ediacaran period.

they suggested that stromatoveris was an evolutionary "aunt" of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system.

ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the bilateria, sister to the cnidaria, sister to cnidaria, placozoa and bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals.
however, other researchers have argued that the placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.
since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles.
a molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. richard harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid.
this suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished.

fresno (/ˈfrɛznoʊ/ frez-noh), the county seat of fresno county, is a city in the u.s. state of california.
it is approximately 220 miles (350 km) northwest of los angeles, 170 miles (270 km) south of the state capital, sacramento, or 185 miles (300 km) south of san francisco.
the name fresno means "ash tree" in spanish, and an ash leaf is featured on the city's flag.

in 1872, the central pacific railroad established a station near easterby's—by now a hugely productive wheat farm—for its new southern pacific line.
many millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community.
fresno became an incorporated city in 1885.
by 1931 the fresno traction company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track.
soon there was a store around the station and the store grew the town of fresno station, later called fresno.
in 1940, the census bureau reported fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% asian. (
incongruously, chinatown was primarily a japanese neighborhood and today japanese-american businesses still remain).
during 1942, pinedale, in what is now north fresno, was the site of the pinedale assembly center, an interim facility for the relocation of fresno area japanese americans to internment camps.

fresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest.
woodward park, which features the shinzen japanese gardens, numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails, is in north fresno and is adjacent to the san joaquin river parkway.
roeding park, near downtown fresno, is home to the fresno chaffee zoo, and rotary storyland and playland.

between the 1880s and world war ii, downtown fresno flourished, filled with electric street cars, and contained some of the san joaquin valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.
among them, the original fresno county courthouse (demolished), the fresno carnegie public library (demolished), the fresno water tower, the bank of italy building, the pacific southwest building, the san joaquin light & power building (currently known as the grand 1401), and the hughes hotel (burned down), to name a few.

fulton street in downtown fresno was fresno's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation's first pedestrian malls in 1964.
renamed the fulton mall, the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in fresno.
while the fulton mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including the only pierre-auguste renoir piece in the world that one can walk up to and touch.
the public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district.

the neighborhood of sunnyside is on fresno's far southeast side, bounded by chestnut avenue to the west.
its major thoroughfares are kings canyon avenue and clovis avenue.
largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction.
although parts of sunnyside are within the city of fresno, much of the neighborhood is a "county island" within fresno county. it is also the home of the sunnyside country club, which maintains a golf course designed by william p. bell.

the popular neighborhood known as the tower district is centered around the historic tower theatre, which is included on the national list of historic places.
the theater was built in 1939 and is at olive and wishon avenues in the heart of the tower district. (
the name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower, which is actually in another nearby area).
to some extent, the businesses of the tower district were developed due to the proximity of the original fresno normal school, (later renamed california state university at fresno).
the tower district neighborhood is just north of downtown fresno proper, and one-half mile south of fresno city college. in 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of fresno city college one-half mile north of the tower district.
this vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] after decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the tower theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second and third run movies, along with classic films.

since renewal, the tower district has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses.
today, the tower district is also known as the center of fresno's lgbt and hipster communities.;
additionally, tower district is also known as the center of fresno's local punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal community.[citation needed]
the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades.
the area includes many california bungalow and american craftsman style homes, spanish colonial revival style architecture, mediterranean revival style architecture, mission revival style architecture, and many storybook houses designed by fresno architects, hilliard, taylor & wheeler.
the residential architecture of the tower district contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of fresno.
the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades.
the section of huntington boulevard between first street on the west to cedar avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes.
the alta vista tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by william stranahan for the pacific improvement corporation, and was officially platted in 1911.
in 1914 developers billings & meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor.
a mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.
this rapid development was no doubt hastened by the fresno traction company right-of-way along huntington boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the county hospital.
the "west side" of fresno, also often called "southwest fresno", is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.
the neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway (which divides it from downtown fresno), west of the 41 freeway and south of nielsen ave (or the newly constructed 180 freeway), and extends to the city limits to the west and south.
the neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of fresno's african-american community.
it is culturally diverse and also includes significant mexican-american and asian-american (principally hmong or laotian) populations.
the "west side" of fresno, also often called "southwest fresno", is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.
the neighborhood includes kearney boulevard, named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire m. theo kearney, which extends from fresno street in southwest fresno about 20 mi (32 km) west to kerman, california.
a small, two-lane rural road for most of its length, kearney boulevard is lined with tall palm trees.
the roughly half-mile stretch of kearney boulevard between fresno street and thorne ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for fresno's elite african-american families.
another section, brookhaven, on the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm, was given the name by the fresno city council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood's image.
another section, brookhaven, on the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm, was given the name by the fresno city council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood's image. the isolated subdivision was for years known as the "dogg pound" in reference to a local gang, and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime.
while many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before, the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the fresno housing authority.
there have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood, including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of fresno and b streets, an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood, and some new section 8 apartments have been built along church ave west of elm st. cargill meat solutions and foster farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood, and the stench from these (and other small industrial facilities) has long plagued area residents.

the fresno chandler executive airport is also on the west side.
the neighborhood has very little retail activity, aside from the area near fresno street and state route 99 freeway (kearney palm shopping center, built in the late 1990s) and small corner markets scattered throughout.
in the north eastern part of fresno, woodward park was founded by the late ralph woodward, a long-time fresno resident.
the initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the city, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2).
the park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic japanese garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the san joaquin river parkway's lewis s. eaton trail.
when complete, the lewis s. eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between highway 99 and friant dam.
the park is open april through october, 6am to 10pm and november through march, 6am to 7pm.

fresno is marked by a semi-arid climate (köppen bsh), with mild, moist winters and hot and dry summers, thus displaying mediterranean characteristics.
december and january are the coldest months, and average around 46.5 °f (8.1 °c), and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually, with the coldest night of the year typically bottoming out below 30 °f (−1.1 °c).
average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1 mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert.
most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest, as winds are driven downward along the axis of the california central valley; in december, january and february there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics.

state route 180 (kings canyon freeway) comes from the west via mendota, and from the east in kings canyon national park going towards the city of reedley.
fresno is the largest u.s. city not directly linked to an interstate highway.
when the interstate highway system was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now interstate 5 on the west side of the central valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now state route 99.

this concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the bell system. starting in the late 1950s, american computer scientist paul baran developed the concept distributed adaptive message block switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation, funded by the us department of defense.
the new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of donald davies at the national physical laboratory (united kingdom) (npl) in the late 1960s. davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in europe in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept in the early arpanet in the united states.

packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes.
in cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages. packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes.

in case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10base5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.
packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers).
packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket.

baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the rand corporation for the us air force into survivable communications networks, first presented to the air force in the summer of 1961 as briefing b-265, later published as rand report p-2626 in 1962, and finally in report rm 3420 in 1964.

the work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.

starting in 1965, donald davies at the national physical laboratory, uk, independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by baran.
he called it packet switching, a more accessible name than baran's, and proposed to build a nationwide network in the uk.

in connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information.
the packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery.
each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. the packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery.
at the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number.
connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication.
the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking.
acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table.
the packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets. routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table.
both x.25 and frame relay provide connection-oriented operations. another major difference between x.25 and frame relay is that x.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted.
both x.25 and frame relay provide connection-oriented operations. it was widely used at the uni for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. for a while, frame relay was used to interconnect lans across wide area networks.
however, x.25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol (ip) at the network layer, and the asynchronous transfer mode (atm) and or versions of multi-protocol label switching (mpls) at layer two.
a typical configuration is to run ip over atm or a version of mpls. however, x.25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol (ip) at the network layer, and the asynchronous transfer mode (atm) and or versions of multi-protocol label switching (mpls) at layer two.
arpanet and sita hln became operational in 1969.
before the introduction of x.25 in 1973, about twenty different network technologies had been developed. two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core.
the user datagram protocol (udp) is an example of a datagram protocol. in the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host.
the user datagram protocol (udp) is an example of a datagram protocol. this results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model.
appletalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by apple inc. in 1985 for apple macintosh computers.
appletalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server.
the appletalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing.
it was a plug-n-play system.
the cyclades packet switching network was a french research network designed and directed by louis pouzin.
it was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself, using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms.

decnet is a suite of network protocols created by digital equipment corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two pdp-11 minicomputers.
initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer osi-compliant networking protocol. it evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming dec into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s.
however, decnet phase ii (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside dec, including one for linux.
in 1965, at the instigation of warner sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect ge's four computer sales and service centers (schenectady, phoenix, chicago, and phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service, apparently the world's first commercial online service.

(
in addition to selling ge computers, the centers were computer service bureaus, offering batch processing services. they lost money from the beginning, and sinback, a high-level marketing manager, was given the job of turning the business around.
he decided that a time-sharing system, based on kemney's work at dartmouth—which used a computer on loan from ge—could be profitable.
merit network, inc., an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation governed by michigan's public universities, was formed in 1966 as the michigan educational research information triad to explore computer networking between three of michigan's public universities as a means to help the state's educational and economic development.
with initial support from the state of michigan and the national science foundation (nsf), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in december 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the ibm mainframe computer systems at the university of michigan in ann arbor and wayne state university in detroit. in october 1972 connections to the cdc mainframe at michigan state university in east lansing completed the triad.
over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the tymnet and telenet public data networks, x.25 host attachments, gateways to x.25 data networks, ethernet attached hosts, and eventually tcp/ip and additional public universities in michigan join the network.
telenet was the first fcc-licensed public data network in the united states.
it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public.
it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public.
it initially used arpanet technology but changed the host interface to x.25 and the terminal interface to x.29.
it went public in 1979 and was then sold to gte. telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the ccitt.
tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in san jose, ca that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used x.25, sna/sdlc, bsc and ascii interfaces to connect host computers (servers)at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies.

users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections.
the business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks.
the private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network.
there were two kinds of x.25 networks.
some older networks such as telenet and tymnet were modified to provide a x.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. datapac was developed by bell northern research which was a joint venture of bell canada (a common carrier) and northern telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier).
x.75 and x.121 allowed the interconnection of national x.25 networks.
austpac was an australian public x.25 network operated by telstra.
started by telecom australia in the early 1980s, austpac was australia's first public packet-switched data network, supporting applications such as on-line betting, financial applications — the australian tax office made use of austpac — and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to austpac up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases.

datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the dutch ptt telecom (now known as kpn).
strictly speaking datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the x.121 dnic 2041), the name also referred to the public pad service telepad (using the dnic 2049).

the computer science network (csnet) was a computer network funded by the u.s. national science foundation (nsf) that began operation in 1981.
its purpose was to extend networking benefits, for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to arpanet, due to funding or authorization limitations.

by 1998, the vbns had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with ds-3 (45 mbit/s), oc-3c (155 mbit/s), and oc-12c (622 mbit/s) links on an all oc-12c backbone, a substantial engineering feat for that time. the network was engineered and operated by mci telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the nsf.
the vbns installed one of the first ever production oc-48c (2.5 gbit/s) ip links in february 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to oc-48c.
the black death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia, where it then travelled along the silk road, reaching crimea by 1343.
the black death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia, where it then travelled along the silk road, reaching crimea by 1343. from there, it was most likely carried by oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships.
spreading throughout the mediterranean and europe, the black death is estimated to have killed 30–60% of europe's total population.
the world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century.
the plague recurred occasionally in europe until the 19th century.
the plague disease, caused by yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including central asia, kurdistan, western asia, northern india and uganda.
nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near lake issyk kul in kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to china and india.
in october 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in china.
in the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.
epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million chinese and other asians during the 15 years before it reached constantinople in 1347.
plague was reportedly first introduced to europe via genoese traders at the port city of kaffa in the crimea in 1347.
after a protracted siege, during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of kaffa to infect the inhabitants.
after a protracted siege, during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of kaffa to infect the inhabitants.
the genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into sicily and the south of europe, whence it spread north.
whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the black death.
from italy, the disease spread northwest across europe, striking france, spain, portugal and england by june 1348, then turned and spread east through germany and scandinavia from 1348 to 1350.
finally it spread to northwestern russia in 1351.
the plague was somewhat less common in parts of europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the kingdom of poland, the majority of the basque country, isolated parts of belgium and the netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.

it was introduced in norway in 1349 when a ship landed at askøy, then spread to bjørgvin (modern bergen) and iceland.
the plague struck various countries in the middle east during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures.
by autumn 1347, the plague reached alexandria in egypt, probably through the port's trade with constantinople, and ports on the black sea.

in england, it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the black death.
the name spread through scandinavia and then germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name.
the most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in paris in a report to the king of france that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air".

this report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. the most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in paris in a report to the king of france that blamed the heavens, in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air". that the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory.
today, this is known as the miasma theory.
the dominant explanation for the black death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern china in 1865, eventually spreading to india.
the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited hong kong in 1894, among whom was the french-swiss bacteriologist alexandre yersin, after whom the pathogen was named yersinia pestis.

the mechanism by which y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by paul-louis simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited hong kong in 1894, among whom was the french-swiss bacteriologist alexandre yersin, after whom the pathogen was named yersinia pestis.
the bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance.
the historian francis aidan gasquet wrote about the 'great pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary eastern or bubonic plague".

he was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the black death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the justinian plague that was prevalent in the eastern roman empire from 541 to 700 ce.

the modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °c (100–106 °f), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise.

left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.
pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent.
symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation).
in october 2010, the open-access scientific journal plos pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of yersinia pestis in the black death following the disputed identification by drancourt and raoult in 1998.

they assessed the presence of dna/rna with polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques for y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern europe that were associated archaeologically with the black death and subsequent resurgences.

ends the debate about the etiology of the black death, and unambiguously demonstrates that y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated europe during the middle ages".
the study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves.
the study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves. these clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern y. pestis strains y. p. orientalis and y. p. medievalis, suggesting the plague may have entered europe in two waves.

surveys of plague pit remains in france and england indicate the first variant entered europe through the port of marseille around november 1347 and spread through france over the next two years, eventually reaching england in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics.

the results of the haensch study have since been confirmed and amended.
based on genetic evidence derived from black death victims in the east smithfield burial site in england, schuenemann et al.
concluded in 2011 "that the black death in medieval europe was caused by a variant of y. pestis that may no longer exist."
a study published in nature in october 2011 sequenced the genome of y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the black death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.
the plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of british bacteriologist j. f. d. shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.

in 1984 zoologist graham twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the black death have been taken up by a number of authors, including samuel k. cohn, jr. (2002), david herlihy (1997), and susan scott and christopher duncan (2001).

it is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period.

most work has been done on the spread of the plague in england, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the domesday book and the year 1377.
estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

in addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the black death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the dna results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.

other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the black death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the black death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the black death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the black death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.

twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and norman cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics.

many scholars arguing for the y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections.
in addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.
in 2014, scientists with public health england announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the clerkenwell area of london, as well as of wills registered in london during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.
the most widely accepted estimate for the middle east, including iraq, iran and syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third.
half of paris's population of 100,000 people died. the black death killed about 40% of egypt's population.
interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in central london found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and christian burials at this time.
in crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die.
the disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.
the plague repeatedly returned to haunt europe and the mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries.
according to biraben, the plague was present somewhere in europe in every year between 1346 and 1671.
according to geoffrey parker, "france alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31."
in england, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million.

an outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–80 could have been as high as 20%.
the most general outbreaks in tudor and stuart england seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the great plague of london in 1665.
in 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in paris.
the black death ravaged europe for three years before it continued on into russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490.
plague occurred in venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.
late outbreaks in central europe included the italian plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the thirty years' war, and the great plague of vienna in 1679.
over 60% of norway's population died in 1348–50. the last plague outbreak ravaged oslo in 1654.
in the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in italy, or about 14% of the population.
in 1656, the plague killed about half of naples' 300,000 inhabitants.
the plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of seville by half.

plague remained a major event in ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century.
baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.
when a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock.
the sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock.
all three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.
there are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
this rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric.
in the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was seafloor spreading, showed that the earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere.

there is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. this coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.

mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, were explained as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.
arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another.

plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for alfred wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the earth over geologic time.
the power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.
seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the earth.
these advances led to the development of a layered model of the earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that.

more recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a ct scan.
therefore, the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale. the second scale compresses the most recent era, so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale.
since the quaternary is a very short period with short epochs, it is further expanded in the fourth scale.
the holocene (the latest epoch) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right, another reason for expanding the fourth scale. the second, third, and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks.
q stands for the quaternary period.
the principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut.
faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault.
finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.
faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault.
a similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. as a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them. the principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them.
these foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix.

the principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them.
for example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer.
the principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks.
based on principles laid out by william smith almost a hundred years before the publication of charles darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought.
the principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.
as organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found.

at the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods.
previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another.
with isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.

these methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement.
for many geologic applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice.

dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. these methods are used for a variety of applications.
when rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker.
because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. in the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock.
these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms".
these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms".
if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. if some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner.
these stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as boudins, after the french word for "sausage", because of their visual similarity.
stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the maria fold and thrust belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the grand canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter.
rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed.
this is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning.
volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below.
dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed.
faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels.
these sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down.
continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit.
the hawaiian islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows.
even older rocks, such as the acasta gneiss of the slave craton in northwestern canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis.
the sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental united states and the grand canyon in the southwestern united states contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since cambrian time.

in many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface.
in addition to identifying rocks in the field, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe.
in an optical mineralogy analysis, thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens.
stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units.

petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear, and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes.

this research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks.
structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks.
structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks.
they also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area.
in addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.
among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges, which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries.

in the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge.

in the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from drill cores.
stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface.
geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions.

stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the earth, interpret past environments, and locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.
in the laboratory, biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them.
these fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed.
other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate. geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.

some modern scholars, such as fielding h. garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to persia after the muslim conquests had come to an end.

in china, the polymath shen kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.
drawing from greek and indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the muslim conquests, the persian scholar ibn sina (avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science.

james hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist.
in 1785 he presented a paper entitled theory of the earth to the royal society of edinburgh.
hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 (vol.
in his paper, he explained his theory that the earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land.

the word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries.
the pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines.
however, the original greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison.
often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in english the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.
the pharmas also used many other herbs not listed.
pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines.

a pharmacy technician in the uk is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians.
a pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the general pharmaceutical council (gphc) register.
the gphc is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.

in most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc.,
where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients.
pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.

because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues (in the hospital and at home) many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area.
those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.

hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital.
most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.
several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding.
several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. the high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.
hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting.
pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.
clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics.
clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care.
they often participate in patient care rounds drug product selection. clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care.

consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. "cognitive services") than on actual dispensing of drugs.
consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.
traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the united states many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily omnicare, kindred healthcare and pharmerica).
this trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.
some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.
since about the year 2000, a growing number of internet pharmacies have been established worldwide.
many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.
internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound.
some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound.
the primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received.
many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the "inconvenience" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe.
however, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication.
there also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products. however, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication.
while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription, some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.

pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science.
pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies.
as a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals.

in addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs.
it is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly fda approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.
specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed.
in addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs.
in most jurisdictions (such as the united states), pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians.
these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public, and that pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them "kickback" payments.
however, the american medical association (ama) code of ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere.

in some rural areas in the united kingdom, there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices.
this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away, or where none is registered in the city.
the law requires that the gp practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometres) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy.
this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away, or where none is registered in the city.
the reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers.
otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in "diagnosing" as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient.
this system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the u.s. and many other governments.[citation needed]
otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in "diagnosing" as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient. such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects.

in the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.
rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.
in particular, medication therapy management (mtm) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.
such services include the thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.
the result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.
in canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in alberta and british columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (medschecks in ontario).
this shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in australia receive remuneration from the australian government for conducting comprehensive home medicines reviews.
they are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews.
in the united states, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.

for instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen. civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict.

more than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians.
moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. however, this definition is disputed by thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective. the individual is the final judge of right and wrong.

some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities.
brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects "a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken".

it is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience.

there have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. black's law dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. christian bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires "carefully chosen and legitimate means," but holds that they do not have to be non-violent.

civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.

non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged "wrong" by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue.

in modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favorable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. this is a form of jail solidarity.[page needed] there have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed.

civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts.
bedau writes, "there is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...the remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity." bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose.
some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and voice in the wilderness, which brought medicine to iraq without the permission of the u.s. government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law.

many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. for example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers.
however, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. for example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers.

an important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty.
there is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law.

one defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, "i plead for the beauty that surrounds us"; this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty. a plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

a well known civil rights attorney, francis heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead "nolo contendere", as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty.
the arrested persons were found "guilty," nevertheless, and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.[citation needed]

the key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. to accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...in particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated."

steven barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, "they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience."

during the vietnam war era, the chicago eight used a political defense, while benjamin spock used a technical defense.
in countries such as the united states whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as sparf v. united states, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and united states v. dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.
one theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished.

one theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. it has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience.
michael bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. one theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.

courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: "indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law."

during the vietnam war, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the vietnam war; the courts ruled it was a political question.
the necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. likewise, when carter wentworth was charged for his role in the clamshell alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the seabrook station nuclear power plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty.
fully informed jury association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to fija, many of them have escaped prosecution because "prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence."
along with giving the offender his "just deserts", achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment.
brownlee argues, "bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law’s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law." leonard hubert hoffmann writes, "in deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good.
it is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not."

construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure.
construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.
construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries.
construction starts with planning,[citation needed] design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.
construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.
large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. an architect normally manages the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project manager supervises it.

for the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential.
the largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.
for the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential.
in general, there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure and industrial.
building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional).
infrastructure is often called heavy/highway, heavy civil or heavy engineering.
building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional).
infrastructure is often called heavy/highway, heavy civil or heavy engineering. it includes large public works, dams, bridges, highways, water/wastewater and utility distribution.
engineering news-record (enr) is a trade magazine for the construction industry.
engineering news-record (enr) is a trade magazine for the construction industry. each year, enr compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies.
in 2014, enr compiled the data in nine market segments.
in their reporting on the top 400, they used data on transportation, sewer, hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.
to recognize the differences of companies in this sector, it is divided into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors.
there are also categories for construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and construction managers (firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project).
the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction.
there are also categories for construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and construction managers (firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project).
building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings.
the majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, such as addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom.
often, the owner of the property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the entire project.
although building construction projects typically include various common elements, such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations, many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation.
for this reason, those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome.
residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice.
residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice.
as residential construction (as well as all other types of construction) can generate a lot of waste, careful planning again is needed here.
materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g. brick versus stone, versus timber).
new techniques of building construction are being researched, made possible by advances in 3d printing technology.
in a form of additive building construction, similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts, building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours, with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities, in one continuous build, using large 3d printers.
in a form of additive building construction, similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts, building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours, with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities, in one continuous build, using large 3d printers. dutch architect janjaap ruijssenaars's performative architecture 3d-printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014.
working versions of 3d-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) of building material per hour as of january 2013[update], with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres (11 ft) per hour, sufficient to complete a building in a week.
in the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality.
a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts.
the design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner.
under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor.
following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.
the modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms.
in the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms.
thus, each such firm may offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction project, from beginning to end.
this is designated as a "design build" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.
several project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering and construction management.
in general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and construction.
in response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.
construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems.
underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project.
cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough.
cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough.
mortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project.
the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project.
the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project.
accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process.
cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.
the project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements.
constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner.
some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations, or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions.
other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations, or things that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district.
other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations, or things that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district. an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community).
a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider.
a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider.
the time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive.
thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out.
contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.
there is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project.
new forms include partnering such as public-private partnering (ppps) aka private finance initiatives (pfis) and alliances such as "pure" or "project" alliances and "impure" or "strategic" alliances.

the focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.

often, it is not just one contractor, but a consortium of several contractors working together.
as they build phase 1, they design phase 2.
before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services.
this lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations.

during the construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code.
once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an occupancy permit may be issued.
in the united states, the industry in 2014 has around $960 billion in annual revenue according to statistics tracked by the census bureau, of which $680 billion is private (split evenly between residential and nonresidential) and the remainder is government.

construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union.
in 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the united states was nearly three times that for all workers.
other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.
falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers.
private schools, also known as independent schools, non-governmental, or nonstate schools, are not administered by local, state or national governments; thus, they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition, rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public (government) funding; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship, which makes the cost cheaper, depending on a talent the student may have (e.g. sport scholarship, art scholarship, academic scholarship), financial need, or tax credit scholarships that might be available.

in the united kingdom and several other commonwealth countries including australia and canada, the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions.
private education in north america covers the whole gamut of educational activity, ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions.
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 (year twelve is known as lower sixth) and year 13 (upper sixth).
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 (year twelve is known as lower sixth) and year 13 (upper sixth).
this category includes university-preparatory schools or "prep schools", boarding schools and day schools.
tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors, including the location of the school, the willingness of parents to pay, peer tuitions and the school's financial endowment.
high tuition, schools claim, is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments, including a low student to teacher ratio, small class sizes and services, such as libraries, science laboratories and computers.
they include parochial schools, a term which is often used to denote roman catholic schools.
other religious groups represented in the k-12 private education sector include protestants, jews, muslims and the orthodox christians. they include parochial schools, a term which is often used to denote roman catholic schools.
some such schools teach religious education, together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend.
some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools. higher-paid teachers; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education.
student uniforms for australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer.
private schools in australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.[citation needed]
although most are non-aligned, some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large, long-established religious foundations, such as the anglican church, uniting church and presbyterian church, but in most cases, they do not insist on their students’ religious allegiance.
they are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style, some catholic schools fall into this category as well, e.g. st joseph's college, gregory terrace, saint ignatius' college, riverview, st gregory's college, campbelltown, st aloysius' college (sydney) and st joseph's college, hunters hill, as well as loreto kirribilli, monte sant angelo mercy college, st ursula's college and loreto normanhurst for girls.

in india, private schools are called independent schools, but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government, it can be an aided or an unaided school.
prominent examination boards that are present in multiple states are the cbse and the cisce, nenbse
among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different examination boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates.

the largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private catholic school system integrated.
as a result, private schools in new zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (auckland, hamilton, wellington and christchurch) and niche markets.
private schools are often anglican, such as king's college and diocesan school for girls in auckland, st paul's collegiate school in hamilton, st peter's school in cambridge, samuel marsden collegiate school in wellington, and christ's college and st margaret's college in christchurch; or presbyterian, such as saint kentigern college and st cuthbert's college in auckland, scots college and queen margaret college in wellington, and st andrew's college and rangi ruru girls' school in christchurch.

government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts' interpretation of the establishment clause of the first amendment or individual state blaine amendments.
non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status.

in 1638, the college became home for north america's first known printing press, carried by the ship john of london.
in 1639, the college was renamed harvard college after deceased clergyman john harvard, who was an alumnus of the university of cambridge.
the charter creating the harvard corporation was granted in 1650.
in the early years the college trained many puritan ministers.[citation needed] (a 1643 publication said the school's purpose was "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust".)
it offered a classic curriculum on the english university model—​​many leaders in the colony had attended the university of cambridge—​​but conformed puritanism.
it was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in congregational and unitarian churches. it offered a classic curriculum on the english university model—​​many leaders in the colony had attended the university of cambridge—​​but conformed puritanism.
throughout the 18th century, enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among congregationalist ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, calvinist parties.:1–4 when the hollis professor of divinity david tappan died in 1803 and the president of harvard joseph willard died a year later, in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements.
henry ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal samuel webber was appointed to the presidency of harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at harvard to the dominance of liberal, arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as unitarian ideas).:4–5:24

in 1846, the natural history lectures of louis agassiz were acclaimed both in new york and on the campus at harvard college.
agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena.
this dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of common sense realism derived from scottish philosophers thomas reid and dugald stewart, whose works were part of the harvard curriculum at the time.
charles w. eliot, president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction.
while eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of american higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by transcendentalist unitarian convictions.
derived from william ellery channing and ralph waldo emerson, these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling god in each person.
james bryant conant (president, 1933–1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions.
he saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth.
the resulting report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of american education in the 20th century.

in marxian analysis, capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs (workers) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits. the substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.
over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the "reserve army of labour"). the substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.

in a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill.
under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. "
employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed.
their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor.
markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair."

thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill.
on the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers." "
markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair."
this is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. an example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. a job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job.
a job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job.
a job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job.
members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.
competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position.

on the other hand, higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level (self-employment).
however, most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity.
necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter ("push" motivations), whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations ("pull") such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs.

the economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.
a progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases.
in a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime.
additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board.

the difference between the gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.
education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. an important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education.
as a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages.
as a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages.
conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.
the justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. as a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages.

in 2014, economists with the standard & poor's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the u.s.'s wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles.

on average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. thomas sowell, in his book knowledge and decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference.

eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.
according to kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth.
as a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality.

economist simon kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development.

wealth concentration is a theoretical[according to whom?]
according to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth.
thomas piketty in his book capital in the twenty-first century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [pp. over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society.

economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as "rent-seeking".
while the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc.,
a better explainer of growing inequality, according to stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them.
this process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from "grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort"
effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems, and lower rates of social goods, a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption, and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption.

british researchers richard g. wilkinson and kate pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy by country, educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) in countries and states with higher inequality.

using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the us, they found social/health problems lower in countries like japan and finland and states like utah and new hampshire with high levels of equality, than in countries (us and uk) and states (mississippi and new york) with large differences in household income.

for most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs, access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives.
this pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries, where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world.

in recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality.

the unicef index of "child well-being in rich countries", studying 40 indicators in 22 countries, correlates with greater equality but not per capita income.
crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society.
most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions.
there have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger.
2001 found that among u.s states and canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality.
they estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state.
following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic.
a house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced "distributive efficiency" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility.
an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person.
thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person ("the additional dollar") decreases as a person becomes richer.
from this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.
conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the us.
will wilkinson of the libertarian cato institute states that "the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality," and consumption is more important than income.
according to johnson, smeeding, and tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986.

according to international monetary fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth).
high levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education.
according to imf staff economists, "if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then gdp growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down.
in contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher gdp growth.

according to economists david castells-quintana and vicente royuela, increasing inequality harms economic growth.
high and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth.
unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.
policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.

the main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development.

in 1993, galor and zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development.
a 1996 study by perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth.
he showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. he found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment.
also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth."

studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the kuznets curve hypothesis, which states that with economic development, inequality first increases, then decreases.

economist thomas piketty challenges this notion, claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and "violent economic and political shocks" reduced inequality.

economist thomas piketty challenges this notion, claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and "violent economic and political shocks" reduced inequality.
some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development.
according to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand.
a 2013 report on nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality.
analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth.
developing countries with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."
while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth.
the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality.
for instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction.
in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki-moon: "while economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty."

in many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system.
much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements.
reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building, in some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land.

a number of researchers (david rodda, jacob vigdor, and janna matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the us – is caused in part by income inequality.
david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (rhoda 1994:148).
david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (rhoda 1994:148).
through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in east new york, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.
the ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.
firstly, certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care.
if the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances.
secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt.

the result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.
the smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation.
if there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. this relation is expressed by the environmental kuznets curve (ekc).[not in citation given] it should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier.

if (as wwf argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage. as such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well.
socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock.

by contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary.
in order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product.

robert nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force.

robert nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force.
however, nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves.
john rawls argued in a theory of justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members.
the capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”.
unlike neoliberalism, which “defines well-being as utility maximization”, economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself.
its goal is to “wid[en] people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).

when a person’s capabilities are lowered, they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise.
an old, ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home.

there may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives.
to prevent such inequality, this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.

although the mongols had ruled territories including today's north china for decades, it was not until 1271 that kublai khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional chinese style.

in official chinese histories, the yuan dynasty bore the mandate of heaven, following the song dynasty and preceding the ming dynasty.
the dynasty was established by kublai khan, yet he placed his grandfather genghis khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as taizu.[b] in the proclamation of the dynastic name (《建國號詔》), kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as great yuan and claimed the succession of former chinese dynasties from the three sovereigns and five emperors to the tang dynasty.
in 1271, kublai khan imposed the name great yuan (chinese: 大元; pinyin: dà yuán; wade–giles: ta-yüan), establishing the yuan dynasty. "
dà yuán" (大元) is from the sentence "大哉乾元" (dà zai qián yuán / "great is qián, the primal") in the commentaries on the classic of changes (i ching) section regarding qián (乾).
the counterpart in mongolian language was dai ön ulus, also rendered as ikh yuan üls or yekhe yuan ulus.
in mongolian, dai ön (great yuan) is often used in conjunction with the "yeke mongghul ulus" (lit. "
furthermore, the yuan is sometimes known as the "empire of the great khan" or "khanate of the great khan", which particularly appeared on some yuan maps, since yuan emperors held the nominal title of great khan.

he died in 1259 without a successor.
kublai returned from fighting the song in 1260 when he learned that his brother, ariq böke, was challenging his claim to the throne.
he bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional chinese dynasties and adopting the chinese era name of zhongtong.
instability troubled the early years of kublai khan's reign.
the hostile but weakened song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south. ogedei's grandson kaidu refused to submit to kublai and threatened the western frontier of kublai's domain.

li tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official, instigated a revolt against mongol rule in 1262.
kublai's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving mongol interests in china and satisfying the demands of his chinese subjects.
he instituted the reforms proposed by his chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy, expanding the circulation of paper money, and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron.
he restored the imperial secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past chinese dynasties unchanged.
however, kublai rejected plans to revive the confucian imperial examinations and divided yuan society into three, later four, classes with the han chinese occupying the lowest rank.

the fourth yuan emperor, buyantu khan (ayurbarwada), was a competent emperor.
he was the first yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream chinese culture after the reign of kublai, to the discontent of some mongol elite.
he had been mentored by li meng, a confucian academic.
he made many reforms, including the liquidation of the department of state affairs (chinese: 尚書省), which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials.
starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials, testing their knowledge on significant historical works.
emperor gegeen khan, ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323.
emperor gegeen khan, ayurbarwada's son and successor, ruled for only two years, from 1321 to 1323.
he continued his father's policies to reform the government based on the confucian principles, with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor baiju.
during his reign, the da yuan tong zhi (chinese: 大元通制, "the comprehensive institutions of the great yuan"), a huge collection of codes and regulations of the yuan dynasty begun by his father, was formally promulgated.
gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction, perhaps steppe elite opposed to confucian reforms.
when yesün temür died in shangdu in 1328, tugh temür was recalled to khanbaliq by the qipchaq commander el temür.
gaining support from princes and officers in northern china and some other parts of the dynasty, khanbaliq-based tugh temür eventually won the civil war against ragibagh known as the war of the two capitals.
however, kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with tugh temür.
he was supposedly killed with poison by el temür, and tugh temür then remounted the throne.
however, kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with tugh temür. he was supposedly killed with poison by el temür, and tugh temür then remounted the throne.
due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by el temür, tugh temür is known for his cultural contribution instead.
his most concrete effort to patronize chinese learning was founding the academy of the pavilion of the star of literature (chinese: 奎章閣學士院), first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake "a number of tasks relating to the transmission of confucian high culture to the mongolian imperial establishment".

the academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books, but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named jingshi dadian (chinese: 經世大典).
tugh temür supported zhu xi's neo-confucianism and also devoted himself in buddhism.
after the death of tugh temür in 1332 and subsequent death of rinchinbal (emperor ningzong) the same year, the 13-year-old toghun temür (emperor huizong), the last of the nine successors of kublai khan, was summoned back from guangxi and succeeded to the throne.

one of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the liao, jin, and song dynasties, which were eventually completed in 1345.
the final years of the yuan dynasty were marked by struggle, famine, and bitterness among the populace.
in time, kublai khan's successors lost all influence on other mongol lands across asia, while the mongols beyond the middle kingdom saw them as too chinese.
uninterested in administration, they were separated from both the army and the populace, and china was torn by dissension and unrest.

from the late 1340s onwards, people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts, floods and the resulting famines, and the government's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support.
in 1351, the red turban rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising.
in 1354, when toghtogha led a large army to crush the red turban rebels, toghun temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal.

he fled north to shangdu from khanbaliq (present-day beijing) in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the míng dynasty (1368–1644), founded by zhu yuanzhang in the south.
the political unity of china and much of central asia promoted trade between east and west. the major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular.
the political unity of china and much of central asia promoted trade between east and west.
it had significantly eased trade and commerce across asia until its decline; the communications between yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in persia, the ilkhanate, encouraged this development.
eastern crops such as carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons, high-quality granulated sugar, and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the yuan dynasty.
western musical instruments were introduced to enrich chinese performing arts.
from this period dates the conversion to islam, by muslims of central asia, of growing numbers of chinese in the northwest and southwest.
buddhism (especially tibetan buddhism) flourished, although taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of buddhism from the yuan government.

advances were realized in the fields of travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education.
the most famous traveler of the period was the venetian marco polo, whose account of his trip to "cambaluc," the capital of the great khan, and of life there astounded the people of europe.

some suggest that marco polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with persian traders since many of the places he named were in persian.
among kublai khan's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer guo shoujing, who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year, which was only 26 seconds off the modern gregorian calendar's measurement.

to provide against possible famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire.
during the yuan period, beijing became the terminus of the grand canal of china, which was completely renovated.
contacts with the west also brought the introduction to china of a major food crop, sorghum, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation.
the yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native chinese people ruled all of china.
mongols are widely known to worship the eternal heaven, and according to the traditional mongolian ideology yuan is considered to be "the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious."
in traditional historiography of china, on the other hand, the yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the song dynasty and the ming dynasty.

who did not consider the yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of china, but rather as a period of foreign domination. in the historiography of mongolia, it is generally considered to be the continuation of the mongol empire.
the system of bureaucracy created by kublai khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the han chinese, khitans, jurchens, mongols, and tibetan buddhists.
while the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native chinese dynasties, the yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. the chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native tang, song, as well as khitan liao and jurchen jin dynasties.
chinese advisers such as liu bingzhong and yao shu gave strong influence to kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of kublai's reign.
this government adopted the traditional chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the central secretariat (zhongshu sheng) to manage civil affairs, the privy council (chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection.
this government adopted the traditional chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the central secretariat (zhongshu sheng) to manage civil affairs, the privy council (chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection.
another example was the insignificance of the ministry of war compared with native chinese dynasties, as the real military authority in yuan times resided in the privy council.
while the existence of these central government departments and the six ministries (which had been introduced since the sui and tang dynasties) gave a sinicized image in the yuan administration, the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions.
for example, the authority of the yuan legal system, the ministry of justice, did not extend to legal cases involving mongols and semuren, who had separate courts of justice.

since its invention in 1269, the 'phags-pa script, a unified script for spelling mongolian, tibetan, and chinese languages, was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty.

most of the emperors could not master written chinese, but they could generally converse well in the language.
the mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with mongol clans, the onggirat, and the ikeres, kept the imperial blood purely mongol until the reign of tugh temur, whose mother was a tangut concubine.
nevertheless, a few other yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities; an example is tugh temur (emperor wenzong), who wrote poetry, painted, read chinese classical texts, and ordered the compilation of books.
the mongols practiced debt slavery, and by 1290 in all parts of the mongol empire commoners were selling their children into slavery.
seeing this as damaging to the mongol nation, kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of mongols.
the average mongol garrison family of the yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure, with income from the harvests of their chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty.
in the china of the yuan, or mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today.
due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others.
often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the song dynasty and the yuan dynasty are linked together.
in yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous yuan poets.
one of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form.
however, unlike the western khanates, the yuan dynasty never converted to islam.
instead, kublai khan, the founder of the yuan dynasty, favored buddhism, especially the tibetan variants.
as a result, tibetan buddhism was established as the de facto state religion.
the top-level department and government agency known as the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs (xuanzheng yuan) was set up in khanbaliq (modern beijing) to supervise buddhist monks throughout the empire.
since kublai khan only esteemed the sakya sect of tibetan buddhism, other religions became less important.

advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the yuan era.
his method is described in the jade mirror of the four unknowns, written in 1303.
guo shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars.
gou derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations.
his calendar, the shoushi li (授時暦) or calendar for fixing the seasons, was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the yuan dynasty.

healers were divided into non-mongol physicians called otachi and traditional mongol shamans.
the mongols characterized otachi doctors by their use of herbal remedies, which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of mongol shamanism.

kublai created the imperial academy of medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors.
confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with confucian virtues.
the chinese medical tradition of the yuan had "four great schools" that the yuan inherited from the jin dynasty. all four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation, but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine.

all four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation, but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine. under the mongols, the practice of chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire.
chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the middle east and the rest of the empire.
the physician wei yilin (1277–1347) invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints, which he performed using anesthetics.
western medicine was also practiced in china by the nestorian christians of the yuan court, where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or muslim medicine.
the nestorian physician jesus the interpreter founded the office of western medicine in 1263 during the reign of kublai.

although the traditional chinese elite were not given their share of power, the mongols and the semuren (various allied groups from central asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the yuan regime a somewhat strong "colonial" coloration.

in general there were very few north chinese or southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that persians did so in the ilkhanate.

the muslims in the semu class also revolted against the yuan dynasty in the ispah rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the muslims were massacred by the yuan loyalist commander chen youding.
the historian frederick w. mote wrote that the usage of the term "social classes" for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth, but just entailed "degrees of privilege" to which they were entitled institutionally and legally, so a person's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing, since there were rich and well socially standing chinese while there were less rich mongol and semu than there were mongol and semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated.

the reason for the order of the classes and the reason why people were placed in a certain class was the date they surrendered to the mongols, and had nothing to do with their ethnicity. the earlier they surrendered to the mongols, the higher they were placed, the more the held out, the lower they were ranked.
major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern chinese manufacturers and merchants.
when the mongols placed the uighurs of the kingdom of qocho over the koreans at the court the korean king objected, then the mongol emperor kublai khan rebuked the korean king, saying that the uighur king of qocho was ranked higher than the karluk kara-khanid ruler, who in turn was ranked higher than the korean king, who was ranked last, because the uighurs surrendered to the mongols first, the karluks surrendered after the uighurs, and the koreans surrendered last, and that the uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting.

the immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease.
to function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue.
in humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.

to function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue.
in many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity.

in humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.
disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer.
in contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms.
common autoimmune diseases include hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
in humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as hiv/aids, or the use of immunosuppressive medication.
it was not until robert koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.
it was not until robert koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.
viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by walter reed.
the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of athens in 430 bc.
if a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response.
if pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response.
this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.
in simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism.
both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules.
in immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system.
conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules.
one class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.
one class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.
microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system. the innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms, or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals, many of which (but not all) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens.
this system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen. the innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.

innate immune defenses are non-specific, meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way.
the waxy cuticle of many leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection.
the waxy cuticle of many leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection. several barriers protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers.
in the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract.
the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.
the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.
the skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins.
enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase a2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials.
vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.
in the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.
vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.
within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as ph or available iron.
however, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an "overgrowth" of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection).
there is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.

inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection.
the symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue.
inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells.
eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes).
common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell.
phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles.
phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines.
once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.
once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. the pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome.
phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.
neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.
neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.
neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes.
during the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection.
macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1.
leukocytes (white blood cells) act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system.
leukocytes (white blood cells) act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system.
innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system.
the innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells.
dendritic cells (dc) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.
they are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system.
dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to t cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.
dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to t cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.
natural killer cells, or nk cells, are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes.
rather, nk cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as "missing self."
this term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called mhc i (major histocompatibility complex) – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells.
those mhc antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (kir) which essentially put the brakes on nk cells.
the adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is "remembered" by a signature antigen.
the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific "non-self" antigens during a process called antigen presentation.
antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.
there are two major subtypes of t cells: the killer t cell and the helper t cell.
in addition there are regulatory t cells which have a role in modulating immune response.
killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules, while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules.
killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules, while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules.
a third, minor subtype are the γδ t cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to mhc receptors.
killer t cells are a sub-group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.
killer t cells are activated when their t cell receptor (tcr) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell.
recognition of this mhc:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the t cell, called cd8.
when an activated t cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter.
the entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis.
the mhc:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's cd4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the t cell (e.g., lck) that are responsible for the t cell's activation.
helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc:antigen complex than observed for killer t cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc:antigen molecule.
helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc:antigen complex than observed for killer t cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc:antigen molecule.
the activation of a resting helper t cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types.
in addition, helper t cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the t cell's surface, such as cd40 ligand (also called cd154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing b cells.
gamma delta t cells (γδ t cells) possess an alternative t cell receptor (tcr) as opposed to cd4+ and cd8+ (αβ) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells, cytotoxic t cells and nk cells.
gamma delta t cells (γδ t cells) possess an alternative t cell receptor (tcr) as opposed to cd4+ and cd8+ (αβ) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells, cytotoxic t cells and nk cells.
like other 'unconventional' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs, such as cd1d-restricted natural killer t cells, γδ t cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity.
on one hand, γδ t cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange tcr genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype.
for example, large numbers of human vγ9/vδ2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted vδ1+ t cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.
a b cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen.
this antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the b cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides.
this combination of mhc and antigen attracts a matching helper t cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the b cell.
when b cells and t cells are activated and begin to replicate, some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells.
throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again. this is "adaptive" because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges.
immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory.
throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again.
newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection.
during pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called igg, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.
during pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called igg, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.
this passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months.
hormones can act as immunomodulators, altering the sensitivity of the immune system.
for example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses.
some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty.
by contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive.
additionally, proteins such as nfil3, which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both t-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc.
as a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.
when suffering from sleep deprivation, active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual.
it is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals.
second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin d.
conversely, some hormones are regulated by the immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity.
this means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via uvb radiation.
the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells.
nk cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors.
tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens.
sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.
unlike animals, plants lack phagocytic cells, but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant.
individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pamps.
when a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant.
when a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant.
systemic acquired resistance (sar) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.
overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the autoimmune disorders.
here, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self, and attacks part of the body.
one of the functions of specialized cells (located in the thymus and bone marrow) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity.
under normal circumstances, many t cells and antibodies react with "self" peptides.
immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive.
the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence.
the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence.
in developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function.
however, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries.
active immunity can also be generated artificially, through vaccination.
the principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism.
the principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism.
this deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility.
bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type ii secretion system.
alternatively, using a type iii secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host.
these proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.
the success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses.
in the mid-1950s, frank burnet, inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne, formulated the clonal selection theory (cst) of immunity.
on the basis of cst, burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: "self" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while "nonself" entities (pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response.
the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex "two-signal" activation of t cells.

anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation.
lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.
lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.
immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent t cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.
in contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and ctls (cytotoxic t lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens.
as well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak.
second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin.
inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.
when a t-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin d receptor.
this is essentially a signaling device that allows the t-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin d, the steroid hormone calcitriol.
t-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin d. not only does the t-cell extend a vitamin d receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin d, calcitriol, but the t-cell expresses the gene cyp27b1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin d, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol.

other immune system cells that are known to express cyp27b1 and thus activate vitamin d calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.
pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens.
antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity.
the complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life.
ribonucleases and the rna interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses.
many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and t cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates.
however, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish.
these animals possess a large array of molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors (vlrs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a small number (one or two) of genes.
many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and t cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates.
it is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response.
immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages.
immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages.
prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses crispr sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of rna interference.
the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between "cellular" and "humoral" theories of immunity.
according to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by elie metchnikoff, it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses.

in contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by robert koch and emil von behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.

clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers.
tumor cells often have a reduced number of mhc class i molecules on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer t cells.
some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine tgf-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes.

hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues.
they are divided into four classes (type i – iv) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction.
they are divided into four classes (type i – iv) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction.
type i hypersensitivity is mediated by ige, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.

an evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis).
some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (leishmania spp.).
some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (leishmania spp.).
other bacteria, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement.
other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include streptococcus (protein g), staphylococcus aureus (protein a), and peptostreptococcus magnus (protein l).
this is called antigenic variation.
an example is hiv, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing.
the parasite trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response.
masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system.
this is called immune surveillance.
the antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.
one example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas.

larger drugs (>500 da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses.
early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set.
the emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics.
a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by b cells.

first, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin.
in addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between apcs and t-cells, a shift of the th1/th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports th1, an increase in overall th cell proliferation, and naïve t cell migration to lymph nodes.

this milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of th1 immune responses.
even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.
these mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system.
this process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.
jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.
in humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes.
the speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases.
this produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback.
this deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.
the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the united nations, set up at the request of member governments.
it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations, the world meteorological organization (wmo) and the united nations environment programme (unep), and later endorsed by the united nations general assembly through resolution 43/53.
the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system".
the ipcc produces reports that support the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc), which is the main international treaty on climate change.
it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations, the world meteorological organization (wmo) and the united nations environment programme (unep), and later endorsed by the united nations general assembly through resolution 43/53.

the organisation is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the wmo.
the ipcc does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data.
lead authors of ipcc reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources. according to ipcc guidelines, authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.
authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources (the "grey literature"), provided that they are of sufficient quality.
examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals.
a chapter typically has two "coordinating lead authors", ten to fifteen "lead authors", and a somewhat larger number of "contributing authors".

they predict that under a "business as usual" (bau) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3 °c per decade during the [21st] century. they calculate with confidence that co2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect.
they judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °c over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability.
in 2001, 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change.

ipcc author richard lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the tar.
for example, lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with climate models. among his criticisms, lindzen has stated that the wgi summary for policymakers (spm) does not faithfully summarize the full wgi report.
for example, lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with climate models.
john houghton, who was a co-chair of tar wgi, has responded to lindzen's criticisms of the spm.
houghton has stressed that the spm is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments, and that any changes to the spm must be supported by scientific evidence.
the preparation and approval process for all ipcc special reports follows the same procedures as for ipcc assessment reports.
in the year 2011 two ipcc special report were finalized, the special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation (srren) and the special report on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation (srex).

both special reports were requested by governments.
while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function, it also supports other activities, such as the data distribution centre and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme, required under the unfccc.
this involves publishing default emission factors, which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production and so on.

the ipcc concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process.
the ipcc has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust.
they expressed regret for "the poor application of well-established ipcc procedures in this instance".
the date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the ipcc from the wwf report, which has misquoted its own source, an icsi report "variations of snow and ice in the past and at present on a global and regional scale".

the mbh99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by jones et al. the jones et al. the schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central england, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of medieval vineyards in england.
these studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the mbh99 based graph featured in publicity.
even at the draft stage, this finding was disputed by contrarians: in may 2000 fred singer's science and environmental policy project held a press event on capitol hill, washington, d.c., featuring comments on the graph wibjörn karlén and singer argued against the graph at a united states senate committee on commerce, science and transportation hearing on 18 july 2000.

another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc, far from overstating dangers and risks, have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels.
when the researchers' analysis was "applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [50–140 cm] above 1990 levels. these values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report, published in 2001".

the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different, if not opposing goals.
according to sheldon ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties.
in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem.

in the uk, a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.
since the ipcc does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies, and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release.
in principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report cannot be included.

in february 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the fourth assessment report, five climate scientists – all contributing or lead ipcc report authors – wrote in the journal nature calling for changes to the ipcc.
in february 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the fourth assessment report, five climate scientists – all contributing or lead ipcc report authors – wrote in the journal nature calling for changes to the ipcc.
they suggested a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body, or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated "living" wikipedia-ipcc.
other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.
a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.
for example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering.
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering.
the uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc.
the property of being prime (or not) is called primality.
a simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division.
these include the miller–rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the aks primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.

as of january 2016[update], the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits.
there are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by euclid around 300 bc.

however, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled.
the first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.

many questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2).
many questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2).
such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers.
primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.
prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.
no even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. this implies that n is not prime.
no even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. this implies that n is not prime.
accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2.
similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.

most early greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime.
in the mid-18th century christian goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with leonhard euler -- who did not agree. by the middle ages and renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number.

for example, derrick norman lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime.
by the early 20th century, mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a "unit".
a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated.
similarly, the sieve of eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1.
furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.

there are hints in the surviving records of the ancient egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the egyptian fraction expansions in the rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites.
however, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the ancient greeks.

euclid's elements (circa 300 bc) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
the sieve of eratosthenes, attributed to eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.
in 1640 pierre de fermat stated (without proof) fermat's little theorem (later proved by leibniz and euler). after the greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century.
in 1640 pierre de fermat stated (without proof) fermat's little theorem (later proved by leibniz and euler).
fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1).
fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1).
the french monk marin mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1, with p a prime.
the most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division.
this routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to  is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.
this routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. if the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime.

for example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite. this routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to  is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.

modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or "monte carlo") and deterministic algorithms.
for example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite.
if we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.
a particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (fermat's little theorem) that np≡n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number.

a flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the carmichael numbers) that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael numbers.
more powerful extensions of the fermat primality test, such as the baillie-psw, miller-rabin, and solovay-strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.

some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number n, multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k, and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) − 1].[citation needed]
are prime for any natural number n. here  represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question.
the latter formula can be shown using bertrand's postulate (proven first by chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3.

the latter formula can be shown using bertrand's postulate (proven first by chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2, for any natural number n > 3. however, computing a or μ requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.
another formula is based on wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.
can have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is one.
if this necessary condition is satisfied, dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes.
what is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run—the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6.
the rows (=progressions) starting with a = 3, 6, or 9 contain at most one prime number.
in all other rows (a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) there are infinitely many prime numbers.
the zeta function is closely related to prime numbers.
for example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then ζ(1) would have a finite value.
however, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes.

another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (basel problem), due to euler,
the unproven riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = −2, −4, ..., all zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2.

the connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] from a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise.
from a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x).

often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved.
one of them is goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes.
as of february 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017.
weaker statements than this have been proven, for example vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes.

it is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1.
these conjectures are special cases of the broad schinzel's hypothesis h. brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2.
for a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly.
in particular, number theorists such as british mathematician g. h. hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.
however, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms.
prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.

another consequence of fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p − 1 or a divisor of p − 1.

the fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p − 1)!
+ 1 is divisible by p. moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n − 1)!

several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as rsa and the diffie–hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example, 512-bit primes are frequently used for rsa and 1024-bit primes are typical for diffie–hellman.).

the evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus magicicada make use of prime numbers.
these insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground.
they only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most.
the logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on magicicadas.
over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.
generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense.
for example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field f containing both 0 and 1. it is either q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name.
for example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots.
any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.
often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components.
prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring r, an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: prime elements and irreducible elements.

an element p of r is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit (i.e., does not have a multiplicative inverse) and satisfies the following requirement: given x and y in r such that p divides the product xy, then p divides x or y. an element is irreducible if it is not a unit and cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units.

the fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains.
an example of such a domain is the gaussian integers z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers.

in ring theory, the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal.
in ring theory, the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal.
prime ideals, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.
the prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), … the fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the lasker–noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.

prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects, via the notion of the spectrum of a ring.
for example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry.
for example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations

in particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime).
certain arithmetic questions related to q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields.
while completing q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers.
this local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.
the french composer olivier messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through "natural phenomena".
in works such as la nativité du seigneur (1935) and quatre études de rythme (1949–50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third étude, "neumes rythmiques".

the rhine (romansh: rein, german: rhein, french: le rhin, dutch: rijn) is a european river that begins in the swiss canton of graubünden in the southeastern swiss alps, forms part of the swiss-austrian, swiss-liechtenstein border, swiss-german and then the franco-german border, then flows through the rhineland and eventually empties into the north sea in the netherlands.

most of the water flows via the constance hopper into the rheinrinne ("rhine gutter") and seerhein.
depending on the water level, this flow of the rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake.
the rhine emerges from lake constance, flows generally westward, as the hochrhein, passes the rhine falls, and is joined by its major tributary, the river aare.
the rhine emerges from lake constance, flows generally westward, as the hochrhein, passes the rhine falls, and is joined by its major tributary, the river aare.
the aare more than doubles the rhine's water discharge, to an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s), and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the dutch border.
the aare also contains the waters from the 4,274 m (14,022 ft) summit of finsteraarhorn, the highest point of the rhine basin.
the rhine roughly forms the german-swiss border from lake constance with the exceptions of the canton of schaffhausen and parts of the cantons of zürich and basel-stadt, until it turns north at the so-called rhine knee at basel, leaving switzerland.

from here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the dutch name rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water.
two thirds of the water flow volume of the rhine flows farther west, through the waal and then, via the merwede and nieuwe merwede (de biesbosch), merging with the meuse, through the hollands diep and haringvliet estuaries, into the north sea.

the name rijn, from here on, is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together formed the main river rhine in roman times.
though they retained the name, these streams no longer carry water from the rhine, but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders.
from wijk bij duurstede, the old north branch of the rhine is called kromme rijn ("bent rhine") past utrecht, first leidse rijn ("rhine of leiden") and then, oude rijn ("old rhine").

the rhine-meuse delta, the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn, close to the dutch-german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn.
the rhine-meuse delta, the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn, close to the dutch-german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn.
since the rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term rhine delta is commonly used.
the shape of the rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations: first, at millingen aan de rijn, the rhine splits into waal and pannerdens kanaal, which changes its name to nederrijn at angeren, and second near arnhem, the ijssel branches off from the nederrijn.
this creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often.
the largest and southern main branch begins as waal and continues as boven merwede ("upper merwede"), beneden merwede ("lower merwede"), noord river ("north river"), nieuwe maas ("new meuse"), het scheur ("the rip") and nieuwe waterweg ("new waterway").

three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the nieuwe merwede ("new merwede"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from boven to beneden merwede; the oude maas ("old meuse"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from beneden merwede into noord, and dordtse kil, which branches off from oude maas.
before the st. elizabeth's flood (1421), the meuse flowed just south of today's line merwede-oude maas to the north sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with waal and lek.

the rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents.
this meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea. the rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents.
at the waal, for example, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between brakel and zaltbommel.
the present mediterranean sea descends from this somewhat larger tethys sea.
in southern europe, the stage was set in the triassic period of the mesozoic era, with the opening of the tethys ocean, between the eurasian and african tectonic plates, between about 240 mbp and 220 mbp (million years before present).
at about 180 mbp, in the jurassic period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the alpine orogeny of the oligocene and miocene periods.
several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of mediterranean geography: iberia pushed up the pyrenees; italy, the alps, and anatolia, moving west, the mountains of greece and the islands.

from the eocene onwards, the ongoing alpine orogeny caused a n–s rift system to develop in this zone.
the main elements of this rift are the upper rhine graben, in southwest germany and eastern france and the lower rhine embayment, in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands.
by the time of the miocene, a river system had developed in the upper rhine graben, that continued northward and is considered the first rhine river. the main elements of this rift are the upper rhine graben, in southwest germany and eastern france and the lower rhine embayment, in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands.
at that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the alps; instead, the watersheds of the rhone and danube drained the northern flanks of the alps.
through stream capture, the rhine extended its watershed southward.
by the pliocene period, the rhine had captured streams down to the vosges mountains, including the mosel, the main and the neckar.

around 2.5 million years ago (ending 11,600 years ago) was the geological period of the ice ages.
since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major ice ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped 120 m (390 ft) and much of the continental margins became exposed.

in the early pleistocene, the rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present north sea.
since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of brest, france and rivers, like the thames and the seine, became tributaries to the rhine.
the last glacial ran from ~74,000 (bp = before present), until the end of the pleistocene (~11,600 bp).
the last glacial ran from ~74,000 (bp = before present), until the end of the pleistocene (~11,600 bp).
during this time, the lower rhine flowed roughly west through the netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the english channel and finally, to the atlantic ocean.
the english channel, the irish channel and most of the north sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today.

most of the rhine's current course was not under the ice during the last ice age; although, its source must still have been a glacier.
a tundra, with ice age flora and fauna, stretched across middle europe, from asia to the atlantic ocean. most of the rhine's current course was not under the ice during the last ice age; although, its source must still have been a glacier.
such was the case during the last glacial maximum, ca.
22,000–14,000 yr bp, when ice-sheets covered scandinavia, the baltics, scotland and the alps, but left the space between as open tundra.
the loess or wind-blown dust over that tundra, settled in and around the rhine valley, contributing to its current agricultural usefulness.
as northwest europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward, frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring.

much of the discharge was routed to the rhine and its downstream extension.
rapid warming and changes of vegetation, to open forest, began about 13,000 bp.
by 9000 bp, europe was fully forested.

as a result of increasing land clearance (bronze age agriculture), in the upland areas (central germany), the sediment load of the rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up.
this caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. as a result of increasing land clearance (bronze age agriculture), in the upland areas (central germany), the sediment load of the rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up.
over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred.
this was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century ad.

the discharge of the rhine is divided among three branches: the river waal (6/9 of total discharge), the river nederrijn – lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the river ijssel (1/9 of total discharge).
the rhine was not known to herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century bc in roman-era geography.
at that time, it formed the boundary between gaul and germania.
the upper rhine had been part of the areal of the late hallstatt culture since the 6th century bc, and by the 1st century bc, the areal of the la tène culture covered almost its entire length, forming a contact zone with the jastorf culture, i.e. the locus of early celtic-germanic cultural contact.
in roman geography, the rhine formed the boundary between gallia and germania by definition; e.g. maurus servius honoratus, commentary on the aeneid of vergil (8.727) (rhenus) fluvius galliae, qui germanos a gallia dividit "(the rhine is a) river of gaul, which divides the germanic people from gaul."
from the death of augustus in ad 14 until after ad 70, rome accepted as her germanic frontier the water-boundary of the rhine and upper danube.
from the death of augustus in ad 14 until after ad 70, rome accepted as her germanic frontier the water-boundary of the rhine and upper danube.
the northern section of this frontier, where the rhine is deep and broad, remained the roman boundary until the empire fell.
the southern part was different. the frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern baden and württemberg.
the germanic populations of these lands seem in roman times to have been scanty, and roman subjects from the modern alsace-lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.
the romans kept eight legions in five bases along the rhine.
the actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed.
between about ad 14 and 180, the assignment of legions was as follows: for the army of germania inferior, two legions at vetera (xanten), i germanica and xx valeria (pannonian troops); two legions at oppidum ubiorum ("town of the ubii"), which was renamed to colonia agrippina, descending to cologne, v alaudae, a celtic legion recruited from gallia narbonensis and xxi, possibly a galatian legion from the other side of the empire.

in 1840, the rhine crisis, prompted by french prime minister adolphe thiers's desire to reinstate the rhine as a natural border, led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in germany.
at the end of world war i, the rhineland was subject to the treaty of versailles.
this decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarised zone, with the german army forbidden to enter. the allies left the rhineland, in 1930 and the german army re-occupied it in 1936, which was enormously popular in germany.

the treaty of versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in germany and is often cited as helping adolf hitler's rise to power.

the rhine bridge at arnhem, immortalized in the book, a bridge too far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for arnhem, during the failed operation market garden of september 1944.
in world war ii, it was recognised that the rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of germany, by the western allies.
the rhine bridge at arnhem, immortalized in the book, a bridge too far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for arnhem, during the failed operation market garden of september 1944.
in a separate operation, the ludendorff bridge, crossing the rhine at remagen, became famous, when u.s. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the germans failed to demolish it.
seven days to the river rhine was a warsaw pact war plan for an invasion of western europe during the cold war. this also became the subject of a film, the bridge at remagen.
until 1932 the generally accepted length of the rhine was 1,230 kilometres (764 miles).
in 1932 the german encyclopedia knaurs lexikon stated the length as 1,320 kilometres (820 miles), presumably a typographical error.

for the next three hundred years, scotland was directly governed by the parliament of great britain and the subsequent parliament of the united kingdom, both seated at westminster, and the lack of a parliament of scotland remained an important element in scottish national identity.

suggestions for a 'devolved' parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the first world war.
a sharp rise in nationalism in scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent labour government of harold wilson to set up the kilbrandon commission to consider the british constitution.
kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected scottish assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic scottish affairs.
during this time, the discovery of oil in the north sea and the following "it's scotland's oil" campaign of the scottish national party (snp) resulted in rising support for scottish independence, as well as the snp.

the party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting scotland as much as they should.
the combined effect of these events led to prime minister wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974.
however, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a scottish assembly were passed by the united kingdom parliament.
under the terms of the scotland act 1978, an elected assembly would be set up in edinburgh provided that the majority of the scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 march 1979 that represented at least 40% of the total electorate.

the 1979 scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved scottish assembly failed.
although the vote was 51.6% in favour of a scottish assembly, this figure did not equal the 40% of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure, as 32.9% of the eligible voting population did not, or had been unable to, vote.

throughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a scottish parliament grew, in part because the government of the united kingdom was controlled by the conservative party, while scotland itself elected relatively few conservative mps.

in the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the campaign for a scottish assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 scottish constitutional convention with various organisations such as scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part.
publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the parliament.
since september 2004, the official home of the scottish parliament has been a new scottish parliament building, in the holyrood area of edinburgh.
the scottish parliament building was designed by spanish architect enric miralles in partnership with local edinburgh architecture firm rmjm which was led by design principal tony kettle.

some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings.
crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the garden lobby, complete the unique architecture.
whilst the permanent building at holyrood was being constructed, the parliament's temporary home was the general assembly hall of the church of scotland on the royal mile in edinburgh.
official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the assembly hall, which is part of the school of divinity of the university of edinburgh.
this building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the church's general assembly.
in may 2000, the parliament was temporarily relocated to the former strathclyde regional council debating chamber in glasgow, and to the university of aberdeen in may 2002.

in addition to the general assembly hall, the parliament also used buildings rented from the city of edinburgh council.
the former administrative building of lothian regional council on george iv bridge was used for the msp's offices.
following the move to holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished.
the former midlothian county buildings facing parliament square, high street and george iv bridge in edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 midlothian county council) housed the parliament's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the parliament's principal committee room.

during debates, the presiding officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. a vote clerk sits in front of the presiding officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.
as a member of the scottish parliamentary corporate body, the presiding officer is responsible for ensuring that the parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate.
convening the parliamentary bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the presiding officer.
under the standing orders of the parliament the bureau consists of the presiding officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the parliament.
the presiding officer also represents the scottish parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity. amongst the duties of the bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the parliament.

parliament typically sits tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays from early january to late june and from early september to mid december, with two-week recesses in april and october.
plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm.
chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public.
entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space.
proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the official report, which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates.
the first item of business on wednesdays is usually time for reflection, at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of faith.

speakers are drawn from across scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the scottish census.
invitations to address parliament in this manner are determined by the presiding officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau. faith groups can make direct representations to the presiding officer to nominate speakers.

normally, the presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak.
typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time.
speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in english, but members may use scots, gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the presiding officer. the scottish parliament has conducted debates in the gaelic language.
each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, msps decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day.
this "decision time" is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the parliamentary campus and alerts msps who are not in the chamber to return and vote.

if there is audible dissent, the presiding officer announces "there will be a division" and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks.
as a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.
the outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote.

parties entrust some msps, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line.
errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright.
this is typically done on moral issues.
immediately after decision time a "members debate" is held, which lasts for 45 minutes.

such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. members business is a debate on a motion proposed by an msp who is not a scottish minister.
as well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate.
the relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to "winds up" the debate by speaking after all other participants.
much of the work of the scottish parliament is done in committee.
the role of committees is stronger in the scottish parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber.

typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the scottish government.
the current subject committees in the fourth session are: economy, energy and tourism; education and culture; health and sport; justice; local government and regeneration; rural affairs, climate change and environment; welfare reform; and infrastructure and capital investment.

a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government.
private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property.

bills pass through parliament in a number of stages:
stage 1 is the first, or introductory stage of the bill, where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to parliament together with its accompanying documents – explanatory notes, a policy memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill, and a financial memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it.

statements from the presiding officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the parliament.
stage 1 usually takes place, initially, in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill.
if the whole parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill, it then proceeds to stage 2.
stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole parliament.
this stage comprises two parts: consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate, and a final vote on the bill.

most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected msps, with the exception of scotland's chief law officers: the lord advocate and the solicitor general.
whilst the first minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the sovereign.
under the scotland act 1998, ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on).
under the scotland act 1998, ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). the following ordinary election reverts to the first thursday in may, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 may 2011, 7 may 2015, etc.).
the date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the monarch on the proposal of the presiding officer.
if the parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the members voting in favour), or if the parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be first minister within 28 days of a general election or of the position becoming vacant, the presiding officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the parliament is dissolved by the queen by royal proclamation.
extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. the following ordinary election reverts to the first thursday in may, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 may 2011, 7 may 2015, etc.).
several procedures enable the scottish parliament to scrutinise the government.
the first minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to parliament upon which msps are invited to question. after the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other msps question the first minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.
for example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the first minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year.
after the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other msps question the first minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.
parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber.
a "general question time" takes place on a thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government.
at 2.30pm, a 40-minute long themed "question time" takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. a "general question time" takes place on a thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government.
this gives members an opportunity to question the first minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction.
the four general questions available to opposition leaders are:
of the 129 msps, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as "constituency msps".
voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency msp.
the 73 scottish parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the uk parliament constituencies in scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of scottish mps, with the exception of orkney and shetland which each return their own constituency msp.
currently, the average scottish parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors.
the island archipelagos of orkney, shetland and the western isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population and distance from the scottish parliament in edinburgh.
the total number of seats in the parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'hondt method.

such qualifications were introduced under the house of commons disqualification act 1975 and the british nationality act 1981. as in the house of commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an msp.
such qualifications were introduced under the house of commons disqualification act 1975 and the british nationality act 1981.
specifically, members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the united kingdom, the republic of ireland, one of the countries in the commonwealth of nations, a citizen of a british overseas territory, or a european union citizen resident in the uk.
members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the scottish parliament as elected msps, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified.

the election produced a majority snp government, making this the first time in the scottish parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority.
the snp took 16 seats from labour, with many of their key figures not returned to parliament, although labour leader iain gray retained east lothian by 151 votes.

the snp took a further eight seats from the liberal democrats and one seat from the conservatives.
the snp overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the scottish parliament to hold a referendum on scottish independence.
for the conservatives, the main disappointment was the loss of edinburgh pentlands, the seat of former party leader david mcletchie, to the snp.

a procedural consequence of the establishment of the scottish parliament is that scottish mps sitting in the uk house of commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to england, wales and northern ireland – whilst english, scottish, welsh and northern irish westminster mps are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the scottish parliament.

this phenomenon is known as the west lothian question and has led to criticism.

islamism, also known as political islam (arabic: إسلام سياسي‎ islām siyāsī), is an islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt "to implement islamic values in all spheres of life."
islamism, also known as political islam (arabic: إسلام سياسي‎ islām siyāsī), is an islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt "to implement islamic values in all spheres of life."
islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the shari'a.
the different islamist movements have been described as "oscillating between two poles": at one end is a strategy of islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion; at the other "reformist" pole islamists work to islamize society gradually "from the bottom up".

moderate and reformist islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the tunisian ennahda movement.
the islamist groups like hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in palestine participate in democratic and political process as well as armed attacks, seeking to abolish the state of israel.

radical islamist organizations like al-qaeda and the egyptian islamic jihad, and groups such as the taliban, entirely reject democracy, often declaring as kuffar those muslims who support it (see takfirism), as well as calling for violent/offensive jihad or urging and conducting attacks on a religious basis.

another major division within islamism is between what graham e. fuller has described as the fundamentalist "guardians of the tradition" (salafis, such as those in the wahhabi movement) and the "vanguard of change and islamic reform" centered around the muslim brotherhood.
olivier roy argues that "sunni pan-islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century" when the muslim brotherhood movement and its focus on islamisation of pan-arabism was eclipsed by the salafi movement with its emphasis on "sharia rather than the building of islamic institutions," and rejection of shia islam.

following the arab spring, roy has described islamism as "increasingly interdependent" with democracy in much of the arab muslim world, such that "neither can now survive without the other."
while islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy.
islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect islam, while the contrary idea that islam is, or can be, apolitical is an error.

hayri abaza argues the failure to distinguish between islam and islamism leads many in the west to support illiberal islamic regimes, to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics.

islamists have asked the question, "if islam is a way of life, how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal, social, political, economic, and political spheres of life are not muslims, but islamists and believe in islamism, not [just] islam?"
similarly, a writer for the international crisis group maintains that "the conception of 'political islam'" is a creation of americans to explain the iranian islamic revolution and apolitical islam was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970", and it is quietist/non-political islam, not islamism, that requires explanation.

the interpretation of islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative saudi-based wahhabism or salafism.
in its harshest form it preached that muslims should not only "always oppose" infidels "in every way," but "hate them for their religion ... for allah's sake," that democracy "is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century," that shia and other non-wahhabi muslims were infidels, etc.

while this effort has by no means converted all, or even most muslims to the wahhabist interpretation of islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the saudi-interpretation of islam as the "gold standard" of religion in minds of some or many muslims.
islamist movements such as the muslim brotherhood, "are well known for providing shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance to students from out of town, student advisory groups, facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands, legal assistance, sports facilities, and women's groups."

while studying law and philosophy in england and germany, iqbal became a member of the london branch of the all india muslim league.
he came back to lahore in 1908.
he was a critic of the mainstream indian nationalist and secularist indian national congress.
iqbal's seven english lectures were published by oxford university press in 1934 in a book titled the reconstruction of religious thought in islam.
iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society, but that india's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage, culture and political influence.

in his travels to egypt, afghanistan, palestine and syria, he promoted ideas of greater islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.
sir muhammad iqbal was elected president of the muslim league in 1930 at its session in allahabad as well as for the session in lahore in 1932.

sayyid abul ala maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the islamic revival in india, and then after independence from britain, in pakistan.
trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about islam and islamic law.
however, maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising.
his extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer islamists such as al-faruqi, whose "islamization of knowledge" carried forward some of maududi's key principles.
maududi also believed that muslim society could not be islamic without sharia, and islam required the establishment of an islamic state.
maududi also believed that muslim society could not be islamic without sharia, and islam required the establishment of an islamic state.
this state should be a "theo-democracy," based on the principles of: tawhid (unity of god), risala (prophethood) and khilafa (caliphate).
although maududi talked about islamic revolution, by "revolution" he meant not the violence or populist policies of the iranian revolution, but the gradual changing the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah.

roughly contemporaneous with maududi was the founding of the muslim brotherhood in ismailiyah, egypt in 1928 by hassan al banna.
under the motto "the qur'an is our constitution," it sought islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools, mosques, and workshops.
like maududi, al banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion, and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the muslim world.
some elements of the brotherhood, though perhaps against orders, did engage in violence against the government, and its founder al-banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of egypt's premier mahmud fami naqrashi three months earlier.

he believed that complete imitation of the prophet mohammad and his successors such as ali for restoration of sharia law was essential to islam, that many secular, westernizing muslims were actually agents of the west serving western interests, and that the acts such as "plundering" of muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against islam by the western governments.

the conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished muslims (mujahideen) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith.

prior to 1990 saudi arabia played an important role in restraining the many islamist groups that received its aid.
but when saddam, secularist and ba'athist dictator of neighboring iraq, attacked saudi arabia (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the saudi monarchy.
islamists accused the saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.
these attacks resonated with conservative muslims and the problem did not go away with saddam's defeat either, since american troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the palestinian-israeli peace process developed.

saudi arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic islamists who attacked it (bin laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to islamic groups (islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced.
one result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in egypt, a bloody civil war in algeria and osama bin laden's terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack.

for some decades prior to the first palestine intifada in 1987, the muslim brotherhood in palestine took a "quiescent" stance towards israel, focusing on preaching, education and social services, and benefiting from israel's "indulgence" to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations.
as the first intifada gathered momentum and palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the brotherhood announced the formation of hamas ("zeal"), devoted to jihad against israel.
rather than being more moderate than the plo, the 1988 hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic state in palestine.

the brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.

his national islamic front first gained influence when strongman general gaafar al-nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979.
turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign islamist banking systems, especially those linked with saudi arabia.
he also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.
after al-nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-nimeiry government with the help of the military.

founded as a broad islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by abbassi madani, and a charismatic islamist young preacher, ali belhadj.
taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist fln government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in arabic rather than french, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young algerian men.
the fis won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'état.

in 1992, the democratic republic of afghanistan ruled by communist forces collapsed, and democratic islamist elements of mujahdeen founded the islamic state of afghanistan.
in 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic islamist movement known as the taliban rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of afghanistan.
the taliban were spawned by the thousands of madrasahs the deobandi movement established for impoverished afghan refugees and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring pakistan.

the taliban differed from other islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as islamic fundamentalist or neofundamentalist, interested in spreading "an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs" under the label of sharia to an entire country.

their ideology was also described as being influenced by wahhabism, and the extremist jihadism of their guest osama bin laden.
in july 1977, general zia-ul-haq overthrew prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto's regime in pakistan.
ali bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.
zia-ul-haq was much more committed to islamism, and "islamization" or implementation of islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and islamism became his "official state ideology".
in pakistan this islamization from above was "probably" more complete "than under any other regime except those in iran and sudan," but zia-ul-haq was also criticized by many islamists for imposing "symbols" rather than substance, and using islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power.
zia-ul-haq was killed in 1988 but islamization remains an important element in pakistani society.
"the islamic state", formerly known as the "islamic state of iraq and the levant" and before that as the "islamic state of iraq", (and called the acronym daesh by its many detractors), is a wahhabi/salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of sunni arabs from iraq and syria.
"the islamic state", formerly known as the "islamic state of iraq and the levant" and before that as the "islamic state of iraq", (and called the acronym daesh by its many detractors), is a wahhabi/salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of sunni arabs from iraq and syria.
in 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all muslims worldwide.
as of march 2015[update], it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in iraq and syria, and has nominal control over small areas of libya, nigeria and afghanistan. (
while a self-described state, it lacks international recognition.)
originating as the jama'at al-tawhid wal-jihad in 1999, it pledged allegiance to al-qaeda in 2004, participated in the iraqi insurgency that followed the march 2003 invasion of iraq by western forces, joined the fight in the syrian civil war beginning in march 2011, and was expelled from al-qaeda in early 2014, (which complained of its failure to consult and "notorious intransigence").

ht sees islam's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of ali, or one of the other four rightly guided caliphs in the 7th century, but with the abolition of the ottoman caliphate in 1924. in its focus on the caliphate, the party takes a different view of muslim history than some other islamists such as muhammad qutb.

following the 9/11 attacks, however, abu hamza al-masri, the imam of the finsbury park mosque, was arrested and charged with incitement to terrorism which has caused many islamists to leave the uk to avoid internment.[citation needed]
the u.s. government has engaged in efforts to counter islamism, or violent islamism, since 2001.
these efforts were centred in the u.s. around public diplomacy programmes conducted by the state department.
there have been calls to create an independent agency in the u.s. with a specific mission of undermining islamism and jihadism. christian whiton, an official in the george w. bush administration, called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of "political warfare" aimed at undermining the ideology.

its name originated from the latin word "imperium", which means to rule over large territories.
imperialism is "a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means".
the term imperialism has been applied to western (and japanese) political and economic dominance especially in asia and africa in the 19th and 20th centuries.
it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas.
imperialism is defined as "a policy of extending a country’s power and influence through diplomacy or military force."
there are "formal" or "informal" imperialisms. "
this is often through various forms of "othering" (see other) based on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes.
informal imperialism" is less direct; however, it is still a powerful form of dominance.
the definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. to clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of "formal" and "informal" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or "full-fledged colonial rule" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance.

the greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded.
european expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory.
the russian leader lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism".
geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.
european empires in asia and africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the european seaborne empires". political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. a distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea".
the term "imperialism" is often conflated with "colonialism", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition.
robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]

imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people.
imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two.
although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism.
although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. the meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance.
colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.
colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.
a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds.
j. a. hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as: "it is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest 'social efficiency'".
friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed.
the purportedly scientific nature of "social darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.
the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout latin america "whiteness" is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common.
political geographers such as friedrich ratzel of germany and halford mackinder of britain also supported imperialism.
political geographers such as friedrich ratzel of germany and halford mackinder of britain also supported imperialism.
these societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.
ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state’s survival while mackinder supported britain’s imperial expansion; these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades. the royal geographical society of london and other geographical societies in europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.

geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance.
for instance, american geographer ellen churchill semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone.
tropicality can be paralleled with edward said’s orientalism as the west’s construction of the east as the “other”.

according to siad, orientalism allowed europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm, which justified its dominance over the essentialized orient.
british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius (latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'empty land'). the principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the british empire "during the last generation, and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description".
british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius (latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'empty land').
the country of australia serves as a case study in relation to british settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century, as it was premised on terra nullius, and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse aboriginal inhabitants.

orientalism, as theorized by edward said, refers to how the west developed an imaginative geography of the east.
rather, by essentializing the east, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between "we" the west and "them" the east, or "here" in the west and "there" in the east. this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west.
this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west. defining the east as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the west’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled.
the discourse of orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories. this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west. defining the east as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the west’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled.

to better illustrate this idea, bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the "scramble for africa".
during his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques, he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory. he states that maps "contributed to empire by promoting, assisting, and legitimizing the extension of french and british power into west africa". this provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain "information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps".

imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of genghis khan during the mongol empire, and of other war-lords.
the americas during the pre-columbian era also had large empires such as the aztec empire and the incan empire.
historically recognized muslim empires number in the dozens.
sub-saharan africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the european colonial era, for example the ethiopian empire, oyo empire, asante union, luba empire, lunda empire, and mutapa empire. historically recognized muslim empires number in the dozens.

cultural imperialism is when a country's influence is felt in social and cultural circles, i.e. its soft power, such that it changes the moral, cultural and societal worldview of another.
the importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. cultural imperialism is when a country's influence is felt in social and cultural circles, i.e. its soft power, such that it changes the moral, cultural and societal worldview of another.
for example, depictions of opulent american lifestyles in the soap opera dallas during the cold war changed the expectations of romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled south korean drama series in north korea.
nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

the age of imperialism, a time period beginning around 1700, saw (generally european) industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power.[citation needed] although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years, the term "age of imperialism" generally refers to the activities of european powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century, for example, the "the great game" in persian lands, the "scramble for africa" and the "open door policy" in china.

europe's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies, in combination with assuming political control by military and political means.

the colonization of india in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus: there, the "british exploited the political weakness of the mughal state, and, while military activity was important at various times, the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance" for the establishment of control over the subcontinent's resources, markets, and manpower.

along with advancements in communication, europe also continued to advance in military technology.
european chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat, and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms.
by the 1880s, the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon.
this technology gave european armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the zulus in southern africa during the anglo-zulu war of 1879).

in anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the british experience.
the term "imperialism" was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli.
for some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.
in his writings lenin portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion.
the correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.
while these non-marxist writers were at their most prolific before world war i, they remained active in the interwar years.
their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the united states from the 1950s.
hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation.

the concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples.
it was believed that a certain person's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination.
for example, people living in tropical environments were seen as "less civilized" therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission.
across the three waves of european colonialism (first in the americas, second in asia and lastly in africa), environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy.
this takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality.
according to geographic scholars under colonizing empires, the world could be split into climatic zones.
these scholars believed that northern europe and the mid-atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being.
the people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the european empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat.
similarly, orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location.
according to geographic scholars under colonizing empires, the world could be split into climatic zones.

republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when germany started to build her own colonial empire.
as it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with france, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading french civilization and language as well as catholicism.
in 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: "the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior".
full citizenship rights – ‘’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. in 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: "the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior".
contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of algeria, where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.
it became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture.

in world war ii, charles de gaulle and the free french used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate france.
however after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the empire.
france fought and lost a bitter war in vietnam in the 1950s.
whereas they won the war in algeria, the french leader at the time, charles de gaulle, decided to grant algeria independence anyway in 1962.
nearly all of france's colonies gained independence by 1960, but france retained great financial and diplomatic influence.
from their original homelands in scandinavia and northern europe, germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western europe in the middle period of classical antiquity; southern europe in late antiquity, conquering celtic and other peoples; and by 800 ce, forming the holy roman empire, the first german empire.

although by 1000 ce, the germanic conquest of central, western, and southern europe (west of and including italy) was complete, excluding only muslim iberia.
there was, however, little cultural integration or national identity, and "germany" remained largely a conceptual term referring to an amorphous area of central europe.
not a maritime power, and not a nation-state, as it would eventually become, germany’s participation in western imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century.
after prussia unified the other states into the second german empire after the franco-german war, its long-time chancellor, otto von bismarck (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits.

he felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the german bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract germany from its central interest, europe itself.
the participation of austria was primarily as a result of habsburg control of the first empire, the spanish throne, and other royal houses.[further explanation needed] after the defeat of napoleon, who caused the dissolution of that holy roman empire, prussia and the german states continued to stand aloof from imperialism, preferring to manipulate the european system through the concert of europe.
however, in 1883–84 germany began to build a colonial empire in africa and the south pacific, before losing interest in imperialism.
historians have debated exactly why germany made this sudden and short-lived move.[verification needed] bismarck was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of german prestige.

the first remedial measure was the warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years.
it also bolstered some kind of conviction among poles that varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.

the goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding.
the goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding. the plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown.
nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the war of independence.
braddock (with george washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in june 1755 to take fort duquesne.
the expedition was a disaster. braddock (with george washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in june 1755 to take fort duquesne.
approximately 1,000 british soldiers were killed or injured. he was killed.
two future opponents in the american revolutionary war, washington and thomas gage, played key roles in organizing the retreat. the remaining 500 british troops, led by george washington, retreated to virginia.
the french acquired a copy of the british war plans, including the activities of shirley and johnson.
shirley's efforts to fortify oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by shirley's inexperience in managing large expeditions.
in conjunction, shirley was made aware that the french were massing for an attack on fort oswego in his absence when he planned to attack fort niagara.
as a response, shirley left garrisons at oswego, fort bull, and fort williams (the latter two located on the oneida carry between the mohawk river and wood creek at present-day rome, new york).
johnson's expedition was better organized than shirley's, which was noticed by new france's governor, the marquis de vaudreuil.
when johnson was seen as the larger threat, vaudreuil sent dieskau to fort st. frédéric to meet that threat.
the two forces finally met in the bloody battle of lake george between fort edward and fort william henry. the battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field.
johnson's advance stopped at fort william henry, and the french withdrew to ticonderoga point, where they began the construction of fort carillon (later renamed fort ticonderoga after british capture in 1759).

other than the campaigns to expel the acadians (ranging around the bay of fundy, on the petitcodiac and st. john rivers, and île saint-jean), the only clashes of any size were at petitcodiac in 1755 and at bloody creek near annapolis royal in 1757. to cut vital supplies to louisbourg, nova scotia's governor charles lawrence ordered the deportation of the french-speaking acadian population from the area.
following the death of braddock, william shirley assumed command of british forces in north america.
at a meeting in albany in december 1755, he laid out his plans for 1756.
in addition to renewing the efforts to capture niagara, crown point and duquesne, he proposed attacks on fort frontenac on the north shore of lake ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the maine district and down the chaudière river to attack the city of quebec.

newcastle replaced him in january 1756 with lord loudoun, with major general james abercrombie as his second in command.
newcastle replaced him in january 1756 with lord loudoun, with major general james abercrombie as his second in command. french regular army reinforcements arrived in new france in may 1756, led by major general louis-joseph de montcalm and seconded by the chevalier de lévis and colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the war of the austrian succession.
during that time in europe, on may 18, 1756, england formally declared war on france, which expanded the war into europe, which was later to be known as the seven years' war.
scouts had reported the weakness of the british supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts shirley had erected at the oneida carry.
in the march battle of fort bull, french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder.
in the march battle of fort bull, french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder.
they set back any british hopes for campaigns on lake ontario, and endangered the oswego garrison, already short on supplies.
when he arrived in albany, abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until loudoun approved them.
building on vaudreuil's work harassing the oswego garrison, montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along lake george.
with abercrombie pinned down at albany, montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on oswego in august.
in the aftermath, montcalm and the indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects.
loudoun, a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on new france's capital, quebec.
leaving a sizable force at fort william henry to distract montcalm, he began organizing for the expedition to quebec.
he was then ordered by william pitt, the secretary of state responsible for the colonies, to attack louisbourg first.
faced with this strength, loudoun returned to new york amid news that a massacre had occurred at fort william henry.
french irregular forces (canadian scouts and indians) harassed fort william henry throughout the first half of 1757.
in february they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen lake george, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification.
when the withdrawal began, some of montcalm's indian allies, angered at the lost opportunity for loot, attacked the british column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves.
vaudreuil and montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the british blockade of the french coastline limited french shipping.
the situation in new france was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of françois bigot, the intendant of the territory.
montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the st. lawrence, with primary defenses at carillon, quebec, and louisbourg, while vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.
the british failures in north america, combined with other failures in the european theater, led to the fall from power of newcastle and his principal military advisor, the duke of cumberland.
he embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by loudoun. newcastle and pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which pitt dominated the military planning. the british failures in north america, combined with other failures in the european theater, led to the fall from power of newcastle and his principal military advisor, the duke of cumberland.
pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops, supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of new france.

the third invasion was stopped with the improbable french victory in the battle of carillon, in which 3,600 frenchmen famously and decisively defeated abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia and native american allies outside the fort the french called carillon and the british called ticonderoga.

abercrombie was recalled and replaced by jeffery amherst, victor at louisbourg. abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent john bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed fort frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for new france's western forts and furs destined for europe.
in the aftermath of generally poor french results in most theaters of the seven years' war in 1758, france's new foreign minister, the duc de choiseul, decided to focus on an invasion of britain, to draw british resources away from north america and the european mainland.
in the aftermath of generally poor french results in most theaters of the seven years' war in 1758, france's new foreign minister, the duc de choiseul, decided to focus on an invasion of britain, to draw british resources away from north america and the european mainland. the invasion failed both militarily and politically, as pitt again planned significant campaigns against new france, and sent funds to britain's ally on the mainland, prussia, and the french navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at lagos and quiberon bay.

british victories continued in all theaters in the annus mirabilis of 1759, when they finally captured ticonderoga, james wolfe defeated montcalm at quebec (in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders), and victory at fort niagara successfully cut off the french frontier forts further to the west and south.

the victory was made complete in 1760 when, despite losing outside quebec city in the battle of sainte-foy, the british were able to prevent the arrival of french relief ships in the naval battle of the restigouche while armies marched on montreal from three sides.

in september 1760, and before any hostilities erupted, governor vaudreuil negotiated from montreal a capitulation with general amherst.
amherst granted vaudreuil's request that any french residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their roman catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes.

the british offered france the choice of surrendering either its continental north american possessions east of the mississippi or the caribbean islands of guadeloupe and martinique, which had been occupied by the british.
france chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of saint pierre and miquelon, two small islands in the gulf of st. lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. they viewed the economic value of the caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent.
britain gained control of french canada and acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily french-speaking roman catholic residents.
the deportation of acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from europe and the colonies further south.
the british resettled many acadians throughout its north american provinces, but many went to france, and some went to new orleans, which they had expected to remain french.

following the treaty, king george iii issued the royal proclamation of 1763 on october 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern canada and the first nations.

included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the appalachian mountains to its indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers.
for many native populations, the elimination of french power in north america meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to british expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession. most went to cuba, including the entire governmental records from st. augustine, although some christianized yamasee were resettled to the coast of mexico.
the ohio country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by braddock and forbes.
although the spanish takeover of the louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the british takeover of spanish florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the british, and a rise in tensions between the choctaw and the creek, historic enemies whose divisions the british at times exploited.

philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force.
a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. in part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion.
with his mathematical insight, sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.

by the early 20th century, einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.
with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light, particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms.
the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed.
only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.:2–10:79 high-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.

aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology.
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology.
in aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different "natural places" therein.
he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their "natural place" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone.

the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei, who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus.

newton's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force.
this law is an extension of galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below).
this law is an extension of galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below).
that is, the first law contradicts the intuitive aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. by making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, newton's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities.
in other words, to phrase matters more technically, the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference, that is, in all frames related by a galilean transformation.
for instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, the laws of physics do not change from being at rest.
this is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle.
from the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: it is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction.
since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable.
the concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity.

the rotational inertia of planet earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year.
this is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the earth, and why newton's laws of motion are more easily discernible in such environments.
this principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity.
newton's second law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass.
accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements.
however, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass.

with some justification, newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed. general relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales.
newton's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects.
newton's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects.
the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[note 3] and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.
this law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with f called the "action" and −f the "reaction". f and −f are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
alternatively, if an external force acts on the system, then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.:19-1
this means that in a closed system of particles, there are no internal forces that are unbalanced.
alternatively, if an external force acts on the system, then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.:19-1
since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.
as with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale.
through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics.

because of these characteristics, forces are classified as "vector quantities". forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is.
this means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities).
for example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. in this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other.
if both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous.
in this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. for example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be.
historically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out.
such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction.
when two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.
however, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.
when two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.
as well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other.
a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east.
summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force.
this is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors.
orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.
for a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.
the static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.
a static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances. for example, an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the "spring reaction force", which equals the object's weight.

for example, an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the "spring reaction force", which equals the object's weight.
using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); archimedes' principle for buoyancy; archimedes' analysis of the lever; boyle's law for gas pressure; and hooke's law for springs.
these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws of motion.
dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic.
galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest.
this was contrary to aristotle's notion of a "natural state" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an "absolute rest frame" did not exist.
for example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. thus, in an aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship.
however, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it.
a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction.
in such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force.
this results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. however, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.
this results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity.
the notion "force" keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the schrödinger equation instead of newtonian equations.

however, the potentials v(x,y,z) or fields, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated similar to classical position variables, i.e., .
this has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes "quantized", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. the notion "force" keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the schrödinger equation instead of newtonian equations.

however, already in quantum mechanics there is one "caveat", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the "spin", and there is the pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables.

depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons.
if two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive).

in modern particle physics, forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons.
with the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics).
the conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be "fundamental interactions".:199–128 when particle a emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle b, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle a making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles a a' exchanging by b. this description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions.
while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of feynman diagrams.
in a feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram.
all of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions.
the strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei.
the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses.
the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses.
for example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other.
for example, isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation.
in the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.
physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything.

what we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of isaac newton.
before newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects.
today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the earth.

this observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass.
newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances.
combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass () and the radius () of the earth to the gravitational acceleration: in particular, newton determined that the acceleration of the moon around the earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law.
further, newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body.
combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass () and the radius () of the earth to the gravitational acceleration:
this constant has come to be known as newton's universal gravitation constant, though its value was unknown in newton's lifetime. in this equation, a dimensional constant  is used to describe the relative strength of gravity.
not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make the first measurement of  using a torsion balance; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the earth since knowing  could allow one to solve for the earth's mass given the above equation.

succinctly stated, newton's law of gravitation states that the force on a spherical object of mass  due to the gravitational pull of mass  is not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make the first measurement of  using a torsion balance; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the earth since knowing  could allow one to solve for the earth's mass given the above equation.
it was only the orbit of the planet mercury that newton's law of gravitation seemed not to fully explain.
some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however, despite some early indications, no such planet could be found.
when albert einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (gr) he turned his attention to the problem of mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy.

since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity.
in gr, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object.
the time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as "gravitational force".
it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. from the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever.
through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz's law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.

the connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge.
this force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field).
the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs.

this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be "self-generating" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light. the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs.
however, attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome.
through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics.
this final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or qed), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons.

it is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force.
however, these characteristics actually result from the pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons.
this means that it takes energy to pack them together. when the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states.
while this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.
the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles.
however, a residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force.

here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more).
this phenomenon is called color confinement.
the weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy w and z bosons.
its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity.

the word "weak" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force.
a consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins.
the normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.
when their electron clouds overlap, pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.:93 the normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object.

tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable.
they can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction.
ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.
by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. these tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.
for every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied.
newton's laws and newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects.

for example, in extended fluids, differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows:
however, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object.

this formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). the stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.:133–134:38-1–38-11

torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position, angular velocity for velocity, and angular momentum for momentum. as a consequence of newton's first law of motion, there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque.
as a consequence of newton's first law of motion, there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque.
likewise, newton's second law of motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body:
this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path.
such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector.
this yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction. this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path.

a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
this means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system.
the force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.

for certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials.
for certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. this is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates.
for example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector.

the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics.
