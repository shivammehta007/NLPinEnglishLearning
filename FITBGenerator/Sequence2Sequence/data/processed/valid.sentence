Julie wasn't late for the class.
I will not do it!
She hadn't been working but she was tired anyway.
They aren't from Berlin.
Had she seen the film already?
We were late for the meeting.
You are happy.
I heard a new song on the radio.
He understood during the class but now he doesn't understand.
Why was the house so messy? What had she been doing?
We have never sung in public before.
He will have arrived.
When will we have been here for six months?
We have already had lunch.
Had I read the book before the class?
She will have watched the film.
She has never let her daughter have a boyfriend.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
I forgot to buy some milk.
She brought some chocolates to the party.
He kept his promise.
Had I been working that day?
It had been snowing for three days.
She will be shopping in New York.
He sat on the old chair, and it broke.
We flew to Sydney.
It had become very cold, so we went inside.
He isn't in the bathroom.
That clock was made in Switzerland.
