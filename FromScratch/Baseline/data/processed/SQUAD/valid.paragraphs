mtv estimated that by the end of 2014, beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history; she succeeded to do so in april 2014.
her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of destiny's child.

frédéric françois chopin (/ˈʃoʊpæn/; french pronunciation: ​[fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ̃.swa ʃɔ.pɛ̃]; 22 february or 1 march 1810 – 17 october 1849), born fryderyk franciszek chopin,[n 1] was a polish and french (by citizenship and birth of father) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the romantic era, who wrote primarily for the solo piano.
frédéric françois chopin (/ˈʃoʊpæn/; french pronunciation: ​[fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ̃.swa ʃɔ.pɛ̃]; 22 february or 1 march 1810 – 17 october 1849), born fryderyk franciszek chopin,[n 1] was a polish and french (by citizenship and birth of father) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the romantic era, who wrote primarily for the solo piano.
chopin was born in what was then the duchy of warsaw, and grew up in warsaw, which after 1815 became part of congress poland.
a child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in warsaw before leaving poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the november 1830 uprising.
frédéric françois chopin (/ˈʃoʊpæn/; french pronunciation: ​[fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ̃.swa ʃɔ.pɛ̃]; 22 february or 1 march 1810 – 17 october 1849), born fryderyk franciszek chopin,[n 1] was a polish and french (by citizenship and birth of father) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the romantic era, who wrote primarily for the solo piano.
in 1835 he obtained french citizenship.
in 1835 he obtained french citizenship.
most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to polish lyrics.
influences on his compositional style include polish folk music, the classical tradition of j. s. bach, mozart and schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well as the paris salons where he was a frequent guest.
however, the composer and his family used the birthdate 1 march,[n 2] which is now generally accepted as the correct date.
in october 1810, six months after fryderyk's birth, the family moved to warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching french at the warsaw lyceum, then housed in the saxon palace.
the father played the flute and violin; the mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the chopins kept.
in october 1810, six months after fryderyk's birth, the family moved to warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching french at the warsaw lyceum, then housed in the saxon palace.
fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the czech pianist wojciech żywny.
his elder sister ludwika also took lessons from żywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother.
by the age of seven fryderyk had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two polonaises, in g minor and b-flat major.
fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the czech pianist wojciech żywny.
the success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before tsar alexander i, who was visiting warsaw; the tsar presented him with a diamond ring.
the success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before tsar alexander i, who was visiting warsaw; the tsar presented him with a diamond ring.
in the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the silesian composer józef elsner at the warsaw conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass and composition.[n 3] throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in warsaw.
his letters home from szafarnia (to which he gave the title "the szafarnia courier"), written in a very modern and lively polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.
here for the first time he encountered polish rural folk music.
in 1827, soon after the death of chopin's youngest sister emilia, the family moved from the warsaw university building, adjacent to the kazimierz palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the krasiński palace on krakowskie przedmieście,[n 5] where chopin lived until he left warsaw in 1830.[n 6] here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the chopin family parlour (salonik chopinów) became a museum in the 20th century.
four boarders at his parents' apartments became chopin's intimates: tytus woyciechowski, jan nepomucen białobłocki, jan matuszyński and julian fontana; the latter two would become part of his paris milieu.
he returned to warsaw in september 1829, where he premiered his piano concerto no.
later that month, in warsaw, the november 1830 uprising broke out, and woyciechowski returned to poland to enlist.
with woyciechowski, he headed for austria, intending to go on to italy.
chopin arrived in paris in late september 1831; he would never return to poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the polish great emigration.
chopin's biographer adam zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be french, despite his father's french origins, and always saw himself as a pole.
chopin was also acquainted with the poet adam mickiewicz, principal of the polish literary society, some of whose verses he set as songs.
chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with maurice schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in france but, through his family connections, also in germany and england.
in 1835 chopin went to carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them.
some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress marie d'agoult's obsession with chopin, while others believe that chopin had become concerned about liszt's growing relationship with george sand.
in 1836, at a party hosted by marie d'agoult, chopin met the french author george sand (born [amantine] aurore [lucile] dupin).
on his return to paris, his association with sand began in earnest, and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers.
he also had problems having his pleyel piano sent to him.
in may 1839 they headed for the summer to sand's estate at nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846.
on 26 july 1840 chopin and sand were present at the dress rehearsal of berlioz's grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale, composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the july revolution.
at the funeral of the tenor adolphe nourrit in paris in 1839, chopin made a rare appearance at the organ, playing a transcription of franz schubert's lied die gestirne.
among the visitors to nohant were delacroix and the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot, whom chopin had advised on piano technique and composition.
from 1842 onwards, chopin showed signs of serious illness.
chopin was utterly indifferent to sand's radical political pursuits, while sand looked on his society friends with disdain.
as the composer's illness progressed, sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to chopin, whom she called her "third child".
in 1847 sand published her novel lucrezia floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as sand and chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped sand correct the printer's galleys.
the 1945 biographical film a song to remember earned cornel wilde an academy award nomination as best actor for his portrayal of the composer.
possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of chopin's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events.
chopin was written by giacomo orefice and produced in milan in 1901.
french writers on chopin (apart from sand) have included marcel proust and andré gide; and he has also featured in works of gottfried benn and boris pasternak.
the warsaw chopin society organizes the grand prix du disque de f. chopin for notable chopin recordings, held every five years.
the british library notes that "chopin's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era."
the earliest recording was an 1895 performance by paul pabst of the nocturne in e major op.
the world's oldest monographic music competition, the international chopin piano competition, founded in 1927, is held every five years in warsaw.
this tour was suggested to him by his scottish pupil jane stirling and her elder sister.
in london chopin took lodgings at dover street, where the firm of broadwood provided him with a grand piano.
during the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in chaillot, out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, princess obreskoff.
in june 1849 his sister ludwika came to paris with her husband and daughter, and in september, supported by a loan from jane stirling, he took an apartment at place vendôme 12.
all his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.
over 230 works of chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost.
he cited bach and mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.
in 1857, 17 polish songs that chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as op.
the present standard musicological reference for chopin's works is the kobylańska catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'kk'), named for its compiler, the polish musicologist krystyna kobylańska.
his works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.
inspired by j.s. bach's the well-tempered clavier, chopin's preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather than bach's chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.
58, written in 1844) are in four movements.
he also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm.
he also notes that chopin was fortunate to arrive in paris in 1831—"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what chopin asked for their lessons"—and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.
schumann named a piece for him in his suite carnaval, and chopin later dedicated his ballade no.
until the tibetan empire's collapse in the 9th century, it was the tang's major rival in dominating inner asia.
with sakya pandita's submission to godan in 1247, tibet was officially incorporated into the mongol empire during the regency of töregene khatun (1241–1246).
though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with china, he still, for a time, claimed universal rule", and yet "despite his successes in china and korea, khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the great khan".
kublai khan did not conquer the song dynasty in south china until 1279, so tibet was a component of the early mongol empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of china under the yuan dynasty (1271–1368).
as evident in his imperial edicts, the hongwu emperor was well aware of the buddhist link between tibet and china and wanted to foster it.
according to the official twenty-four histories, the history of ming compiled in 1739 by the subsequent qing dynasty (1644–1912), the ming dynasty established the "é-lì-sī army-civilian marshal office" (chinese: 俄力思軍民元帥府) in western tibet and installed the "ü-tsang itinerant high commandery" and "amdo-kham itinerant high commandery" to administer kham.
yet van praag describes the distinct and long-lasting tibetan law code established by the phagmodru ruler tai situ changchub gyaltsen as one of many reforms to revive old imperial tibetan traditions.
wang and nyima argue that the ming emperor sent edicts to tibet twice in the second year of the ming dynasty, and demonstrated that he viewed tibet as a significant region to pacify by urging various tibetan tribes to submit to the authority of the ming court.
for example, an edict of the hongwu emperor in 1373 appointed the tibetan leader choskunskyabs as the general of the ngari military and civil wanhu office, stating:
for example, instead of the 13 governorships established by the mongol sakya viceroy, changchub gyaltsen divided central tibet into districts (dzong) with district heads (dzong dpon) who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old imperial tibet.
according to chen, the ming officer of hezhou (modern day linxia) informed the hongwu emperor that the general situation in dbus and gtsang "was under control," and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second phagmodru ruler, jamyang shakya gyaltsen, an official title.
dreyfus writes that after the phagmodrupa lost its centralizing power over tibet in 1434, several attempts by other families to establish hegemonies failed over the next two centuries until 1642 with the 5th dalai lama's effective hegemony over tibet.

rossabi writes that tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the ming court, so he sent his disciple chosrje shākya yeshes to nanjing in 1414 on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the yongle emperor bestowed upon him the title of "state teacher"—the same title earlier awarded the phagmodrupa ruler of tibet.
even though the gelug exchanged gifts with and sent missions to the ming court up until the 1430s, the gelug was not mentioned in the mingshi or the mingshi lu.
even though the gelug exchanged gifts with and sent missions to the ming court up until the 1430s, the gelug was not mentioned in the mingshi or the mingshi lu.
wylie asserts that this type of censorship of the history of ming distorts the true picture of the history of sino-tibetan relations, while the ming court granted titles to various lamas regardless of their sectarian affiliations in an ongoing civil war in tibet between competing buddhist factions.
helmut hoffman states that the ming upheld the facade of rule over tibet through periodic missions of "tribute emissaries" to the ming court and by granting nominal titles to ruling lamas, but did not actually interfere in tibetan governance.
during his travels beginning in 1403, deshin shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the ming court to visit nanjing by april 10, 1407.
the yongle emperor came out of the palace in nanjing to greet the karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal.
at linggu temple in nanjing, he presided over the religious ceremonies for the yongle emperor's deceased parents, while twenty-two days of his stay were marked by religious miracles that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the emperor's seal.
thinley writes that before the karmapa returned to tibet, the yongle emperor began planning to send a military force into tibet to forcibly give the karmapa authority over all the tibetan buddhist schools but deshin shekpa dissuaded him.
marsha weidner states that deshin shekpa's miracles "testified to the power of both the emperor and his guru and served as a legitimizing tool for the emperor's problematic succession to the throne," referring to the yongle emperor's conflict with the previous jianwen emperor.
the information office of the state council of the prc preserves an edict of the zhengtong emperor (r. 1435–1449) addressed to the karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the ming court.
wang and nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that tibetan areas were ruled by the ming since tibetan leaders were granted positions as ming officials, that horses were collected from tibet as a mandatory "corvée" tax, and therefore tibetans were "undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy".
discussions of strategy in the mid ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the ordos region, which the mongols used as a rallying base to stage raids into ming china.
elliot sperling, a specialist of indian studies and the director of the tibetan studies program at indiana university’s department of central eurasia studies, writes that "the idea that tibet became part of china in the 13th century is a very recent construction."
according to him, the tibetan lamas and mongol khans upheld a "mutual role of religious prelate and secular patron," respectively.
it also states that the ming dynasty "inherited the right to rule tibet" from the yuan dynasty, and repeats the claims in the mingshi about the ming establishing two itinerant high commands over tibet.
during the reign of the jiajing emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native chinese ideology of daoism was fully sponsored at the ming court, while tibetan vajrayana and even chinese buddhism were ignored or suppressed.
meanwhile, the tumed mongols began moving into the kokonor region (modern qinghai), raiding the ming chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of beijing under altan khan (1507–1582).
meanwhile, the tumed mongols began moving into the kokonor region (modern qinghai), raiding the ming chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of beijing under altan khan (1507–1582).
after altan khan made peace with the ming dynasty in 1571, he invited the third hierarch of the gelug—sönam gyatso (1543–1588)—to meet him in amdo (modern qinghai) in 1578, where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of dalai lama—"ocean teacher".
in 1642, the 5th dalai lama (1617–1682) became the first to wield effective political control over tibet.
chen states that the fourth dalai lama yonten gyatso was granted the title "master of vajradhara" and an official seal by the wanli emperor in 1616.
he adds that the ming court's lack of concern for tibet was one of the reasons why the mongols pounced on the chance to reclaim their old vassal of tibet and "fill once more the political vacuum in that country."
tensions rose between the nationalistic ü-tsang ruler and the mongols who safeguarded their mongol dalai lama in lhasa.
meanwhile, the chinese ming dynasty fell to the rebellion of li zicheng (1606–1645) in 1644, yet his short-lived shun dynasty was crushed by the manchu invasion and the han chinese general wu sangui (1612–1678).
there are three current versions of the ipod: the ultra-compact ipod shuffle, the compact ipod nano and the touchscreen ipod touch.
apple's itunes software (and other alternative software) can be used to transfer music, photos, videos, games, contact information, e-mail settings, web bookmarks, and calendars, to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of apple macintosh and microsoft windows operating systems.
though the ipod was released in 2001, its price and mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004.
the special edition entitled purchasers to an exclusive video with 33 minutes of interviews and performance by u2, downloadable from the itunes store.

the third generation began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for firewire or usb connectivity.
the second-, third-, and fourth-generation ipod shuffle uses a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock.
among the first accessory manufacturers were griffin technology, belkin, jbl, bose, monster cable, and sendstation.
bmw released the first ipod automobile interface, allowing drivers of newer bmw vehicles to control an ipod using either the built-in steering wheel controls or the radio head-unit buttons.
alternative connection methods include adapter kits (that use the cassette deck or the cd changer port), audio input jacks, and fm transmitters such as the itrip—although personal fm transmitters are illegal in some countries.
unlike most other media players, apple does not support microsoft's wma audio format—but a converter for wma files without digital rights management (drm) is provided with the windows version of itunes.
the ipod line can play several audio file formats including mp3, aac/m4a, protected aac, aiff, wav, audible audiobook, and apple lossless.
universal music group decided not to renew their contract with the itunes store on july 3, 2007.

ipods often receive favorable reviews; scoring on looks, clean design, and ease of use.
ipod batteries are not designed to be removed or replaced by the user, although some users have been able to open the case themselves, usually following instructions from third-party vendors of ipod replacement batteries.
apple announced a battery replacement program on november 14, 2003, a week before a high publicity stunt and website by the neistat brothers.
the initial cost was us$99, and it was lowered to us$59 in 2005.

originally planned for release on the gamecube in november 2005, twilight princess was delayed by nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the wii.
the story focuses on series protagonist link, who tries to prevent hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the twilight realm.
the game takes place hundreds of years after ocarina of time and majora's mask, in an alternate timeline from the wind waker.
link can walk, run, and attack, and will automatically jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge.[c] link uses a sword and shield in combat, complemented with secondary weapons and items, including a bow and arrows, a boomerang, bombs, and the clawshot (similar to the hookshot introduced earlier in the the legend of zelda series).[d] while l-targeting, projectile-based weapons can be fired at a target without the need for manual aiming.[c]
however, "wolf link" gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human (though riding epona is still faster) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items, and has improved senses, including the ability to follow scent trails.[i] he also carries midna, a small imp-like creature who gives him hints, uses an energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long distances, and eventually allows link to "warp" to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld.[j] using link's wolf senses, the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the twilight, as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named poes.[k]

the game was scheduled to be released the next year, and was no longer a follow-up to the wind waker; a true sequel to it was released for the nintendo ds in 2007, in the form of phantom hourglass.
aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed the minish cap for the game boy advance.
at the same time, the wii was under development with the code name "revolution".

since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in harper lee's hometown of monroeville, alabama.
to kill a mockingbird was lee's only published book until go set a watchman, an earlier draft of to kill a mockingbird, was published on july 14, 2015.
she attended huntingdon college in montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the university of alabama (1945–49).
after finishing the first draft and returning it to lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled "go set a watchman", fell into the hands of therese von hohoff torrey — known professionally as tay hohoff — a small, wiry veteran editor in her late 50s.

judge taylor appoints atticus to defend tom robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, mayella ewell.
atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that ewell simply fell on his own knife.
lee has said that to kill a mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author "should write about what he knows and write truthfully".
in 1960, capote and lee traveled to kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for capote's nonfiction novel in cold blood.
she is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.
any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused.
the children internalize atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.
one year after its publication to kill a mockingbird had been translated into ten languages.
in the years since, it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages.
lee's older sister, alice, responded to the rumor, saying: "that's the biggest lie ever told."
the book was made into the well-received 1962 film with the same title, starring gregory peck as atticus finch.
in may 2005, lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the los angeles public library at the request of peck's widow veronique, who said of lee: "she's like a national treasure.

sergel's play toured in the uk starting at west yorkshire playhouse in leeds in 2006, and again in 2011 starting at the york theatre royal, both productions featuring duncan preston as atticus finch.
one writer was so impressed by lee's detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism.
some lamented the use of poor white southerners, and one-dimensional black victims, and granville hicks labeled the book "melodramatic and contrived".
when the book was first released, southern writer flannery o'connor commented, "i think for a child's book it does all right.

solar radiation is absorbed by the earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere.
passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the sun.
in 1897, frank shuman, a u.s. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine.
a solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building.
these cookers reach temperatures of 315 °c (599 °f) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the sun.
the simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by horace de saussure in 1767.
since 1985 the eventually 354 mw segs csp installation, in the mojave desert of california, is the largest solar power plant in the world.
other large csp plants include the 150 mw solnova solar power station and the 100 mw andasol solar power station, both in spain.
the higher temperatures are a result of increased absorption of the solar light by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment.
agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants.
the designed allows the aircraft to remain airborne for 36 hours.
the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute uses a 1 mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (zno) at temperatures above 1,200 °c (2,200 °f).
thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water, earth and stone.
although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154 gw as of 2007.
for example, iso 9050 relates to glass in building while iso 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters.
time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for solar panels to absorb.
csp systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam.
advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the greeks and chinese, who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth.

drawing inspiration from artists such as gary numan, tj swan and boy george, and maintaining a "minimal but functional" approach towards the album's studio production, west explored the electronic feel produced by auto-tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808, manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks.
the album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synthesizers, and somber piano, and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups, with west himself later confessing an affinity with british post-punk group joy division.
entertainment weekly's simon vozick-levinson perceives that such elements "all recur at various points", namely "the luxurious soul of 2004's the college dropout, the symphonic pomp of late registration, the gloss of 2007's graduation, and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008's 808s & heartbreak".

buddhism /ˈbudɪzəm/ is a nontheistic religion[note 1] or philosophy (sanskrit: धर्म dharma; pali: धम्म dhamma) that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to gautama buddha, commonly known as the buddha ("the awakened one").

in theravada buddhism, the ultimate goal is the attainment of the sublime state of nirvana, achieved by practicing the noble eightfold path (also known as the middle way), thus escaping what is seen as a cycle of suffering and rebirth.
other practices are ten meritorious deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.

earlier biographies such as the buddhacarita, the lokottaravādin mahāvastu, and the sarvāstivādin lalitavistara sūtra, give different accounts.
the evidence of the early texts suggests that siddhārtha gautama was born in a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the northeastern indian subcontinent in the fifth century bce.
according to this narrative, shortly after the birth of young prince gautama, an astrologer named asita visited the young prince's father, suddhodana, and prophesied that siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man, depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls.
so in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach.
but he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest.
now, as the buddha, he spent the rest of his life teaching the path of awakening he had discovered, traveling throughout the northeastern part of the indian subcontinent, and died at the age of 80 (483 bce) in kushinagar, india.

at the age of 35, he famously sat in meditation under a ficus religiosa tree now called the bodhi tree in the town of bodh gaya and vowed not to rise before achieving enlightenment.
samsara arises out of avidya (ignorance) and is characterized by dukkha (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction).
specifically, samsara refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another within the six realms of existence,[note 2] where each realm can be understood as physical realm or a psychological state characterized by a particular type of suffering.
samsara arises out of avidya (ignorance) and is characterized by dukkha (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction).
in buddhism, karma (from sanskrit: "action, work") is the force that drives saṃsāra—the cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being.
the avoidance of unwholesome actions and the cultivation of positive actions is called sīla.
karma specifically refers to those actions of body, speech or mind that spring from mental intent (cetanā), and bring about a consequence or phala "fruit" or vipāka "result".
rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic, ever-changing process of pratītyasamutpāda ("dependent arising") determined by the laws of cause and effect (karma) rather than that of one being, reincarnating from one existence to the next.
according to east asian and tibetan buddhism, there is an intermediate state (tibetan "bardo") between one life and the next.
within the context of the four noble truths, the origin of dukkha is commonly explained as craving (pali: tanha) conditioned by ignorance (pali: avijja).
on a deeper level, the root cause of dukkha is identified as ignorance (pali: avijja) of the true nature of things.
the second truth is that the origin of dukkha can be known.
of the four, mettā or loving-kindness meditation is perhaps the best known.[web 5] the four immeasurables are taught as a form of meditation that cultivates "wholesome attitudes towards all sentient beings.
while he searched for enlightenment, gautama combined the yoga practice of his teacher kalama with what later became known as "the immeasurables".[dubious – discuss] gautama thus invented a new kind of human, one without egotism.[dubious – discuss] what thich nhat hanh calls the "four immeasurable minds" of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity[full citation needed] are also known as brahmaviharas, divine abodes, or simply as four immeasurables.[web 5] pema chödrön calls them the "four limitless ones".
an important guiding principle of buddhist practice is the middle way (or middle path), which is said to have been discovered by gautama buddha prior to his enlightenment.
in awakening to the true nature of the self and all phenomena one develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and is liberated from suffering (dukkha) and the cycle of incessant rebirths (saṃsāra).
impermanence (pāli: anicca) expresses the buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena (all things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent.
the doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering (dukkha).
suffering (pāli: दुक्ख dukkha; sanskrit दुःख duḥkha) is also a central concept in buddhism.
by analyzing the constantly changing physical and mental constituents (skandhas) of a person or object, the practitioner comes to the conclusion that neither the respective parts nor the person as a whole comprise a self.
it is variously rendered into english as "dependent origination", "conditioned genesis", "dependent relationship", "dependent co-arising", "interdependent arising", or "contingency".
according to the jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc.
the term for anybody who has achieved nirvana, including the buddha, is arahant.
therefore, according to mahayana buddhism, the arahant has attained only nirvana, thus still being subject to delusion, while the bodhisattva not only achieves nirvana but full liberation from delusion as well.
a buddha is no longer bound by samsara and has ended the suffering which unawakened people experience in life.
the pali canon refers to many previous ones (see list of the 28 buddhas), while the mahayana tradition additionally has many buddhas of celestial, rather than historical, origin (see amitabha or vairocana as examples, for lists of many thousands buddha names see taishō shinshū daizōkyō numbers 439–448).
buddhists believe gautama buddha was the first to achieve enlightenment in this buddha era and is therefore credited with the establishment of buddhism.
according to mahayana teachings, these perfections are: dāna, śīla, kṣanti, vīrya, dhyāna, and prajñā.
one key innovative teaching of the buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition.
infant baptism).
according to the scriptures, gautama buddha presented himself as a model.
according to the law of karma, keeping the precepts is meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects.
regarding the monastic rules, the buddha constantly reminds his hearers that it is the spirit that counts.
the evidence of the early texts suggests that at the time of the buddha, many male and female lay practitioners did practice meditation, some even to the point of proficiency in all eight jhānas (see the next section regarding these).[note 11]
in the language of the noble eightfold path, samyaksamādhi is "right concentration".
though based upon mahayana, tibeto-mongolian buddhism is one of the schools that practice vajrayana or "diamond vehicle" (also referred to as mantrayāna, tantrayāna, tantric buddhism, or esoteric buddhism).
buddhism arose in greater magadha, which stretched from sravasti, the capital of kosala in the north-west, to rajagrha in the south east.
the buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true veda that he refused to pay respect to the vedas of his time.
bronkhorst agrees that dhyana was a buddhist invention, whereas norman notes that "the buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices."
yet, it is not clear what he was awakened to.[page needed] "liberating insight" is a later addition to this text, and reflects a later development and understanding in early buddhism.[page needed][page needed] the mentioning of the four truths as constituting "liberating insight" introduces a logical problem, since the four truths depict a linear path of practice, the knowledge of which is in itself not depicted as being liberating.[note 34]
although "nibbāna" (sanskrit: nirvāna) is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, many other terms can be found throughout the nikayas, which are not specified.[note 35]
according to vetter, the description of the buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way".
the dipavamsa of the theravāda says that the losing party in the second council dispute broke away in protest and formed the mahasanghika.
scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century bce, 100 to 200 years after the death of the buddha.
several scholars have suggested that the prajñāpāramitā sūtras, which are among the earliest mahāyāna sūtras, developed among the mahāsāṃghika along the kṛṣṇa river in the āndhra region of south india.
according to a demographic analysis reported by peter harvey (2013): mahayana has 360 million adherents; theravada has 150 million adherents; and vajrayana has 18,2 million adherents.
mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the nālandā university in north-eastern india.
the mañjusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the saiva, garuda and vaisnava tantras will be effective if applied by buddhists since they were all taught originally by manjushri.
some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach.
the size and complexity of the buddhist canons have been seen by some (including buddhist social reformer babasaheb ambedkar) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of buddhist philosophy.
he states: "the theravadins, then, may have added texts to the canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period."
the mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of buddhist scriptures that the mahayana buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the buddha.
the mahayana sutras often claim to articulate the buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for those who follow the bodhisattva path.
in addition, east asian buddhism recognizes some sutras regarded by scholars as of chinese rather than indian origin.
as the modern theravada school is descended from a branch of buddhism that diverged and established itself in sri lanka prior to the emergence of the mahayana texts, debate exists as to whether the theravada were historically included in the hinayana designation; in the modern era, this label is seen as derogatory, and is generally avoided.

american idol is an american singing competition series created by simon fuller and produced by 19 entertainment, and is distributed by fremantlemedia north america.
it began airing on fox on june 11, 2002, as an addition to the idols format based on the british series pop idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of american television.
the series was also said by a rival tv executive to be "the most impactful show in the history of television".
according to billboard magazine, in its first ten years, "idol has spawned 345 billboard chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including kelly clarkson, carrie underwood, chris daughtry, fantasia, ruben studdard, jennifer hudson, clay aiken, adam lambert and jordin sparks while remaining a tv ratings juggernaut."
for an unprecedented eight consecutive years, from the 2003–04 television season through the 2010–11 season, either its performance or result show had been ranked number one in u.s. television ratings.
american idol was based on the british show pop idol created by simon fuller, which was in turn inspired by the new zealand television singing competition popstars.
a fourth judge, radio dj stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing "image concerns".
the show had originally planned on having four judges following the pop idol format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely randy jackson, paula abdul and simon cowell.
on january 11, 2010, simon cowell announced that he was leaving the show to pursue introducing the american version of his show the x factor to the usa for 2011.
although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these make it past the preliminary round of auditions.

ruben studdard emerged as the winner, beating clay aiken by a small margin.
much media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, fantasia barrino, latoya london, and jennifer hudson, dubbed the three divas.
fantasia released as her coronation single "i believe", a song co-written by season one finalist tamyra gray, and degarmo released "dreams".
the performance of "summertime" by barrino, later known simply as "fantasia", at top 8 was widely praised, and simon cowell considered it as his favorite idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.
during the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.

teenager sanjaya malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo, and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog vote for the worst and satellite radio personality howard stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him.
the media focused on the professional status of the season seven contestants, the so-called 'ringers', many of whom, including kristy lee cook, brooke white, michael johns, and in particular carly smithson, had prior recording contracts.
david cook's performance of "billie jean" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the chris cornell arrangement to be david cook's own even though the performance was introduced as cornell's version.
this was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto itunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of itunes sales charts.

although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in eurasia 40,000 years ago.
this impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the western world.
the term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of proto-indo-european vocabulary.
the father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam.
later genetic studies strongly supported dogs and gray wolves forming two sister monophyletic clades within the one species, and that the common ancestor of dogs and extant wolves is extinct.
these dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists.
nearly all dog breeds' genetic closeness to the gray wolf are due to admixture, except several arctic dog breeds are close to the taimyr wolf of north asia due to admixture.
dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

"the most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. (
there are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.
the majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack.
another study of dogs' roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn.
they have been bred for herding livestock, hunting (e.g. pointers and hounds), rodent control, guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as companions.
in conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard.
in some places, however, such as in rural areas of poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—being good for the lungs for instance.
in the 1980s and 1990s the us averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26.

the first complete genome sequences among all three domains of life were released within a short period during the mid-1990s: the first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of haemophilus influenzae, completed by a team at the institute for genomic research in 1995.
a fundamental step in the project was the release of a detailed genomic map by jean weissenbach and his team at the genoscope in paris.
when talking about genome composition, one should distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes as the big differences on contents structure they have.
this phenomenon also indicates the mighty influence coming from repetitive dna act on the genomes.
the work is both in vivo and in silico.
the proportion of non-repetitive dna is calculated by using the length of non-repetitive dna divided by genome size.
in some plants and amphibians, the proportion of non-repetitive dna is no more than 20%, becoming a minority component.
there are two categories of repetitive dna in genome: tandem repeats and interspersed repeats.
it is believed that tes are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes.

in 1630, pope urban viii decreed their title to be eminence (previously, it had been "illustrissimo" and "reverendissimo")  and decreed that their secular rank would equate to prince, making them secondary only to the pope and crowned monarchs.
in latin, on the other hand, the [first name] cardinal [surname] order is used in the proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon: "annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus papam: eminentissimum ac reverendissimum dominum, dominum (first name) sanctae romanae ecclesiae cardinalem (last name), ..." (meaning: "i announce to you a great joy; we have a pope: the most eminent and most reverend lord, lord (first name) cardinal of the holy roman church (last name), ...") this assumes that the new pope had been a cardinal just before becoming pope; the most recent election of a non-cardinal as pope was in 1378.

a further complication however concerns the consonant clusters *ćw and *dźw:
good candidates are the hypothethical ancestor languages of alanian/scytho-sarmatian subgroup of scythian in the far northwest; and the hypothetical "old parthian" (the old iranian ancestor of parthian) in the near northwest, where original *dw > *b (paralleling the development of *ćw).

it is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function, a standardized model of human visual brightness perception.
lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed.
the human circadian system is entrained to a 24-hour light-dark pattern that mimics the earth’s natural light/dark pattern.
according to the energy saving trust, led lamps use only 10% power compared to a standard incandescent bulb, where compact fluorescent lamps use 20% and energy saving halogen lamps 70%.
this certification process is one of three national (u.s.) examinations (the others are clep and clmc) in the lighting industry and is open not only to designers, but to lighting equipment manufacturers, electric utility employees, etc.
strict separation of powers did not operate in the united kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the u.s. constitution.[citation needed] under the uk westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, parliament (consisting of the sovereign (king-in-parliament), house of lords and house of commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority.

architects such as mies van der rohe, philip johnson and marcel breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the industrial revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures.
by mid-century, modernism had morphed into the international style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the twin towers of new york's world trade center designed by minoru yamasaki.
while it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism, others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture.

the human development report for 2007/2008 was launched in brasília, brazil, on november 27, 2007.
a hdi below 0.5 is considered to represent "low development".
the human development index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called "western models of development", failure to include any ecological considerations, lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization, focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking, lack of attention to development from a global perspective, measurement error of the underlying statistics, and on the undp's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low', 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' human development countries.

the term heresy is from greek αἵρεσις originally meant "choice" or "thing chosen", but it came to mean the "party or school of a man's choice" and also referred to that process whereby a young person would examine various philosophies to determine how to live.
this reinforcement of the church's authority gave church leaders the power to, in effect, pronounce the death sentence upon those whom the church considered heretical.
within six years of the official criminalization of heresy by the emperor, the first christian heretic to be executed, priscillian, was condemned in 386 by roman secular officials for sorcery, and put to death with four or five followers.
he stigmatizes jewish prayer as being "blasphemous" (sic) and a lie, and vilifies jews in general as being spiritually "blind" and "surely possessed by all devils."
in england, the 16th-century european reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy.
during the thirty-eight years of henry viii's reign, about sixty heretics, mainly protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably sir thomas more and cardinal john fisher, for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the church in england.
the era of mass persecution and execution of heretics under the banner of christianity came to an end in 1826 with the last execution of a "heretic", cayetano ripoll, by the catholic inquisition.
scientist/author isaac asimov considered heresy as an abstraction, asimov's views are in forward: the role of the heretic.
but on average, for the last fifty years, the field hasn't tested dinosaur orthodoxy severely enough."

philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter, such as: spacetime, physical energies and forces, dark matter, and so on.
in ancient indian philosophy, materialism developed around 600 bc with the works of ajita kesakambali, payasi, kanada, and the proponents of the cārvāka school of philosophy.
when madhavacharya compiled sarva-darśana-samgraha (a digest of all philosophies) in the 14th century, he had no cārvāka/lokāyata text to quote from, or even refer to.
daniel dennett, willard van orman quine, donald davidson, and jerry fodor—operate within a broadly physicalist or materialist framework, producing rival accounts of how best to accommodate mind, including functionalism, anomalous monism, identity theory, and so on.
according to the dominant cosmological model, the lambda-cdm model, less than 5% of the universe's energy density is made up of the "matter" described by the standard model of particle physics, and the majority of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy - with little agreement amongst scientists about what these are made of.
in 1991, gribbin and davies released their book the matter myth, the first chapter of which, "the death of materialism", contained the following passage:
in the annals he relates that "by vulgar appellation [they were] commonly called christians" and identifies christians as nero's scapegoats for the great fire of rome.
the nun or ن— the first letter of nasara—was spray-painted on the property of christians ejected from the city.
where there is a distinction, nasrani refers to people from a christian culture and masihi means those with a religious faith in jesus.
the most common persian word is masīhī (مسیحی), from arabic.
in the indian subcontinent, christians call themselves isaai (hindi: ईसाई, urdu: عیسائی‎), and are also known by this term to adherents of other religions.
in the past, the malays used to call the portuguese serani from the arabic nasrani, but the term now refers to the modern kristang creoles of malaysia.
korean still uses 기독교도, kidok-kyo-do for "christian", though the greek form kurisudo 그리스도 has now replaced the old sino-korean kidok, which refers to christ himself.
later the region saw the first states to adopt christianity officially - initially in armenia (301 ad) and in georgia (337 ad), later in the great russian principality (kyivan rus, russian: великое княжество русское, ca 988 ad).

philips' acquisition of mercury records in the us in 1961 paved the way for this.
in march 1968, cbs and sony formed cbs/sony records, a japanese business joint venture.
with sony being one of the developers behind the compact disc digital music media, a compact disc production plant was constructed in japan under the joint venture, allowing cbs to begin supplying some of the first compact disc releases for the american market in 1983.
by 1987, cbs was the only "big three" american tv network to have a co-owned record company.

a hunter-gatherer is a human living in a society in which most or all food is obtained by foraging (collecting wild plants and pursuing wild animals), in contrast to agricultural societies, which rely mainly on domesticated species.
only a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture and/or keeping animals.
in the 1950s, lewis binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging, not hunting.
according to the endurance running hypothesis, long-distance running as in persistence hunting, a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times, was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics.
agriculture originated and spread in several different areas including the middle east, asia, mesoamerica, and the andes beginning as early as 12,000 years ago.
some hunter-gatherer cultures, such as the indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast, lived in particularly rich environments that allowed them to be sedentary or semi-sedentary.
the systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible, although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal.
at the 1966 "man the hunter" conference, anthropologists richard borshay lee and irven devore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population.
at the same conference, marshall sahlins presented a paper entitled, "notes on the original affluent society", in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short," as thomas hobbes had put it in 1651.
james woodburn uses the categories "immediate return" hunter-gatherers for egalitarian and "delayed return" for nonegalitarian.
hunting-gathering was the common human mode of subsistence throughout the paleolithic, but the observation of current-day hunters and gatherers does not necessarily reflect paleolithic societies; the hunter-gatherer cultures examined today have had much contact with modern civilization and do not represent "pristine" conditions found in uncontacted peoples.
lee and guenther have rejected most of the arguments put forward by wilmsen.
these activities are on an entirely different scale to those associated with agriculture, but they are nevertheless domestication on some level.
one such group is the pila nguru (spinifex people) of western australia, whose habitat in the great victoria desert has proved unsuitable for european agriculture (and even pastoralism).[citation needed] another are the sentinelese of the andaman islands in the indian ocean, who live on north sentinel island and to date have maintained their independent existence, repelling attempts to engage with and contact them.[citation needed]
this regional adaptations would become the norm, with reliance less on hunting and gathering, with a more mixed economy of small game, fish, seasonally wild vegetables and harvested plant foods.
in 1971 it was placed under the authority of the united nations general assembly.
in september 2015, the 193 member states of the united nations unanimously adopted the sustainable development goals, a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world over the next 15 years.

alexander bell was born in edinburgh, scotland, on march 3, 1847.
he had two brothers: melville james bell (1845–70) and edward charles bell (1848–67), both of whom would die of tuberculosis.
his best friend was ben herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays.
bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study acoustics.
at an early age, however, he was enrolled at the royal high school, edinburgh, scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.
while his brother constructed the throat and larynx, bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull.
after he taught it to growl continuously, bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding "ow ah oo ga ma ma".
throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion.
after landing at quebec city the bells transferred to another steamer to montreal and then boarded a train to paris, ontario, to stay with the reverend thomas henderson, a family friend.
returning home to brantford after six months abroad, bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph".[n 12] the basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.
by 1874, bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) and at his family home in canada a big success.[n 14] while working that summer in brantford, bell experimented with a "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations.
in 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of western union president william orton, had become "the nervous system of commerce".
in 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of western union president william orton, had become "the nervous system of commerce".
orton had contracted with inventors thomas edison and elisha gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.
however, a chance meeting in 1874 between bell and thomas a. watson, an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of charles williams, changed all that.
on february 14, 1876, gray filed a caveat with the u.s. patent office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter.
bell's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound" [n 16] bell returned to boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in gray's patent caveat.
this time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in brantford reading and singing.
the bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by elisha gray and amos dolbear.
mabel and bell mobilized the community to help victims in halifax.
baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.
the aea was headed by bell and the founding members were four young men: american glenn h. curtiss, a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man", having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the scientific american trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the western hemisphere, and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; lieutenant thomas selfridge, an official observer from the u.s. federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future; frederick w. baldwin, the first canadian and first british subject to pilot a public flight in hammondsport, new york, and j.a.d. mccurdy —baldwin and mccurdy being new engineering graduates from the university of toronto.
lt.
on february 23, 1909, bell was present as the silver dart flown by j.a.d. mccurdy from the frozen ice of bras d'or, made the first aircraft flight in canada.
in his lecture memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race presented to the national academy of sciences on november 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.
in partnership with gardiner greene hubbard, bell helped establish the publication science during the early 1880s.
in 1898, bell was elected as the second president of the national geographic society, serving until 1903, and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations, including photography, in the magazine.
the french government conferred on him the decoration of the légion d'honneur (legion of honor); the royal society of arts in london awarded him the albert medal in 1902; the university of würzburg, bavaria, granted him a phd, and he was awarded the franklin institute's elliott cresson medal in 1912.
the first day of issue ceremony was held on october 28 in boston, massachusetts, the city where bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf.

alexander graham bell was ranked 57th among the 100 greatest britons (2002) in an official bbc nationwide poll, and among the top ten greatest canadians (2004), and the 100 greatest americans (2005).
bell died of complications arising from diabetes on august 2, 1922, at his private estate, beinn bhreagh, nova scotia, at age 75.
to help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist jean macdonald sang a verse of robert louis stevenson's "requiem":
a pub /pʌb/, or public house is, despite its name, a private house, but is called a public house because it is licensed to sell alcohol to the general public.
inns are buildings where travellers can seek lodging and, usually, food and drink.
famous london inns include the george, southwark and the tabard.
the inns of court and inns of chancery in london started as ordinary inns where barristers met to do business, but became institutions of the legal profession in england and wales.
the distinction[clarification needed] was illustrated by william hogarth in his engravings beer street and gin lane.
under the 1830 act any householder who paid rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £168 today), to sell beer or cider in his home (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises.
in the first year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the combined total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels.
although the new licensing laws prevented new beer houses from being created, those already in existence were allowed to continue and many did not close until nearly the end of the 19th century.
often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service.
there was a special case established under the state management scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in carlisle.
in scotland, this stemmed out of[clarification needed] a late repeal of the wartime licensing laws, which stayed in force until 1976.
a few pubs have stage performances such as serious drama, stand-up comedy, musical bands, cabaret or striptease; however juke boxes, karaoke and other forms of pre-recorded music have otherwise replaced the musical tradition of a piano or guitar and singing.[citation needed]

after the development of the large london porter breweries in the 18th century, the trend grew for pubs to become tied houses which could only sell beer from one brewery (a pub not tied in this way was called a free house).
most such breweries, such as the regional brewery shepherd neame in kent and young's and fuller's in london, control hundreds of pubs in a particular region of the uk, while a few, such as greene king, are spread nationally.
the earliest signs were often not painted but consisted, for example, of paraphernalia connected with the brewing process such as bunches of hops or brewing implements, which were suspended above the door of the pub.
these pubs were named after john manners, marquess of granby, who was the son of john manners, 3rd duke of rutland and a general in the 18th century british army.
these pubs were named after john manners, marquess of granby, who was the son of john manners, 3rd duke of rutland and a general in the 18th century british army.
many names for pubs that appear nonsensical may have come from corruptions of old slogans or phrases, such as "the bag o'nails" (bacchanals), "the goat and compasses" (god encompasseth us), "the cat and the fiddle" (chaton fidèle: faithful kitten) and "the bull and bush", which purportedly celebrates the victory of henry viii at "boulogne bouche" or boulogne-sur-mer harbour.

in denmark—a country, like britain, with a long tradition of brewing—a number of pubs have opened which eschew "theming", and which instead focus on the business of providing carefully conditioned beer, often independent of any particular brewery or chain, in an environment which would not be unfamiliar to a british pub-goer.
in ireland, pubs are known for their atmosphere or "craic".
in irish, a pub is referred to as teach tábhairne ("tavernhouse") or teach óil ("drinkinghouse").

some consider storyboards and wordless novels to be comics.
towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.
similarly, the chinese term manhua and the korean manhwa derive from the chinese characters with which the japanese term manga is written.
it was named after saint helena of constantinople.
though they formed no permanent settlement, the island was an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships travelling from asia to europe, and frequently sick mariners were left on the island to recover, before taking passage on the next ship to call on the island.
the coolie labourers arrived in 1810, and their numbers reached 600 by 1818.

the nearest port on the continent is namibe in southern angola, and the nearest international airport the quatro de fevereiro airport of angola's capital luanda; connections to cape town in south africa are used for most shipping needs, such as the mail boat that serves the island, the rms st helena.
the climate of saint helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the benguela current and trade winds that blow almost continuously.
in 1840, st helena became a provisioning station for the british west africa squadron, preventing slavery to brazil (mainly), and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island.
imported chinese labourers arrived in 1810, reaching a peak of 618 in 1818, after which numbers were reduced.
other christian denominations on the island include: roman catholic (since 1852), salvation army (since 1884), baptist (since 1845) and, in more recent times, seventh-day adventist (since 1949), new apostolic and jehovah's witnesses (of which one in 35 residents is a member, the highest ratio of any country).
public expenditure rose from £10 million in 2001-02 to £12 million in 2005-06 to £28m in 2012-13.
unemployment levels are low (31 individuals in 2013, compared to 50 in 2004 and 342 in 1998).
the first helicopter landing at the new airfield was conducted by the wildcat hma.2 zz377 from 825 squadron 201 flight, embarked on visiting hms lancaster on 23 october 2015.
a minibus offers a basic service to carry people around saint helena, with most services designed to take people into jamestown for a few hours on weekdays to conduct their business.
it was launched in january 2005 and closed on 21 december 2012.
sure provide the telecommunications service in the territory through a digital copper-based telephone network including adsl-broadband service.
a satellite ground station with a 7.6-metre (25 ft) satellite dish installed in 1989 at the briars is the only international connection providing satellite links through intelsat 707 to ascension island and the united kingdom.
a satellite ground station with a 7.6-metre (25 ft) satellite dish installed in 1989 at the briars is the only international connection providing satellite links through intelsat 707 to ascension island and the united kingdom.
since all international telephone and internet communications are relying on this single satellite link both internet and telephone service are subject to sun outages.
saint helena telephone numbers changed from 4 to 5 digits on 1 october 2013 by being prefixed with the digit "2", i.e. 2xxxx, with the range 5xxxx being reserved for mobile numbering, and 8xxx being used for tristan da cunha numbers (these still shown as 4 digits).
saint helena has the international calling code +290 which, since 2006, tristan da cunha shares.
adsl-broadband service is provided with maximum speeds of up to 1536 kbit/s downstream and 512 kbit/s upstream offered on contract levels from lite £16 per month to gold+ at £190 per month.
there are a few public wifi hotspots in jamestown, which are also being operated by sure (formerly cable & wireless).
the st helena independent has been published since november 2005.
saint helena is a member of the international island games association.
there are no dedicated ipa symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked: unaspirated ⟨k⟩ and aspirated ⟨kʰ⟩. an old symbol for light aspiration was ⟨ʻ⟩, but this is now obsolete.
preaspirated consonants are marked by placing the aspiration modifier letter before the consonant symbol: ⟨ʰp⟩ represents the preaspirated bilabial stop.
unaspirated or tenuis consonants are occasionally marked with the modifier letter for unaspiration ⟨◌˭⟩, a superscript equal sign: ⟨t˭⟩. usually, however, unaspirated consonants are left unmarked: ⟨t⟩.
voiceless consonants are produced with the vocal folds open (spread) and not vibrating, and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed and vibrating (modal voice).
aspiration varies with place of articulation.
when aspirated consonants are doubled or geminated, the stop is held longer and then has an aspirated release.
icelandic and faroese have preaspirated [ʰp ʰt ʰk]; some scholars interpret these as consonant clusters as well.
they have been documented in kelabit taa, and the kx'a languages.
in native dravidian words, there is no distinction between these categories and stops are underspecified for voicing and aspiration.
later, during the koine greek period, the aspirated and voiceless stops /tʰ d/ of attic greek lenited to voiceless and voiced fricatives, yielding /θ ð/ in medieval and modern greek.
in ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol h+.
in 1766–81, henry cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in greek, hydrogen means "water-former".
hydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen) is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume.
hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, which are also potentially dangerous acids.
the energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the earth's orbit of the sun.
although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, there are over 100 binary borane hydrides known, but only one binary aluminium hydride.
this function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron hydrides) and aluminium complexes, as well as in clustered carboranes.
the symbols d and t (instead of 2h and 3h) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, p, is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium.
in 1671, robert boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas.
in 1766, henry cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction "flammable air".
deuterium was discovered in december 1931 by harold urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by ernest rutherford, mark oliphant, and paul harteck.
the first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by jacques charles in 1783.
in the same year the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at dayton, ohio, by the dayton power & light co.; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today.
the large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to redshift z=4.
the process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used.
at high temperatures (1000–1400 k, 700–1100 °c or 1300–2000 °f), steam (water vapor) reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and h 2.
under anaerobic conditions, iron and steel alloys are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen (h 2).
hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals.
liquid h2 is used in cryogenic research, including superconductivity studies.
the natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.
some such organisms, including the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria, have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast.
many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given).
the american professor robert h. goddard had worked on developing solid-fuel rockets since 1914, and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the us army signal corps only five days before the signing of the armistice that ended world war i. he also started developing liquid-fueled rockets in 1921; yet he had not been taken seriously by the public, and was not sponsored by the government as part of the post-ww ii rocket development effort.
these tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space, and the first two-stage rocket, the wac corporal-v2 combination, in 1949.
given this new danger, the united states participated in an arms race with the soviet union that included development of the hydrogen bomb, as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
having suffered at least 27 million casualties during world war ii after being invaded by nazi germany in 1941, the soviet union was wary of its former ally, the united states, which until late 1949 was the sole possessor of atomic weapons.
in 1953, korolev was given the go-ahead to develop the r-7 semyorka rocket, which represented a major advance from the german design.
it was successfully tested on august 21, 1957 and became the world's first fully operational icbm the following month.
in 1950, von braun began testing the air force pgm-11 redstone rocket family at cape canaveral.
on september 20, 1956, von braun and his team did launch a jupiter-c that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit, but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of nose cone reentry technology.
the soviet success caused public controversy in the united states, and eisenhower ordered the civilian rocket and satellite project, vanguard, to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned.
his mercury-atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the friendship 7 spacecraft, and splashed down safely in the atlantic ocean, after a tense reentry, due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat-shield.
tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists, but tereshkova was the only one to fly.
the circumlunar program (zond), created by vladimir chelomey's design bureau okb-52, was to fly two cosmonauts in a stripped-down soyuz 7k-l1, launched by chelomey's proton ur-500 rocket.
they made ten orbits in twenty hours, and transmitted one of the most watched tv broadcasts in history, with their christmas eve program from lunar orbit, that concluded with a reading from the biblical book of genesis.
the launch pad explosion of the n-1 on july 3, 1969 was a significant setback.
after achieving orbit, armstrong and aldrin transferred into the lunar module, named eagle, and after a landing gear inspection by collins remaining in the command/service module columbia, began their descent.
it weighed 169,950 pounds (77,090 kg), was 58 feet (18 m) long by 21.7 feet (6.6 m) in diameter, with a habitable volume of 10,000 cubic feet (280 m3).
in may 1972, president richard m. nixon and soviet premier leonid brezhnev negotiated an easing of relations known as detente, creating a temporary "thaw" in the cold war.
the united states' national defense education act of 1958 increased funding for these goals from childhood education through the post-graduate level.
the first web browser was invented in 1990 by sir tim berners-lee.
opera debuted in 1996; it has never achieved widespread use, having less than 2% browser usage share as of february 2012 according to net applications.
its opera-mini version has an additive share, in april 2011 amounting to 1.1% of overall browser use, but focused on the fast-growing mobile phone web browser market, being preinstalled on over 40 million phones.
that browser would eventually evolve into firefox, which developed a respectable following while still in the beta stage of development; shortly after the release of firefox 1.0 in late 2004, firefox (all versions) accounted for 7% of browser use.
apple's safari had its first beta release in january 2003; as of april 2011, it had a dominant share of apple-based web browsing, accounting for just over 7% of the entire browser market.
internet explorer, on the other hand, was bundled free with the windows operating system (and was also downloadable free), and therefore it was funded partly by the sales of windows to computer manufacturers and direct to users.
in january 2009, the european commission announced it would investigate the bundling of internet explorer with windows operating systems from microsoft, saying "microsoft's tying of internet explorer to the windows operating system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice."

the primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources to the user ("retrieval" or "fetching"), allowing them to view the information ("display", "rendering"), and then access other information ("navigation", "following links").
in firefox, web feeds are formatted as "live bookmarks" and behave like a folder of bookmarks corresponding to recent entries in the feed.
the beidou navigation satellite system (bds, simplified chinese: 北斗卫星导航系统; traditional chinese: 北斗衛星導航系統; pinyin: běidǒu wèixīng dǎoháng xìtǒng) is a chinese satellite navigation system.
the second generation of the system, officially called the beidou navigation satellite system (bds) and also known as compass or beidou-2, will be a global satellite navigation system consisting of 35 satellites, and is under construction as of january 2015[update].
the second generation of the system, officially called the beidou navigation satellite system (bds) and also known as compass or beidou-2, will be a global satellite navigation system consisting of 35 satellites, and is under construction as of january 2015[update].
it became operational in china in december 2011, with 10 satellites in use, and began offering services to customers in the asia-pacific region in december 2012.
the name literally means "northern dipper", the name given by ancient chinese astronomers to the seven brightest stars of the ursa major constellation.
the first satellite, beidou-1a, was launched on 30 october 2000, followed by beidou-1b on 20 december 2000.
it was reported that the satellite had suffered from a control system malfunction but was then fully restored.
on 15 january 2010, the official website of the beidou navigation satellite system went online, and the system's third satellite (compass-g1) was carried into its orbit by a long march 3c rocket on 17 january 2010.
in 2007, the official xinhua news agency reported that the resolution of the beidou system was as high as 0.5 metres.
in 2008, a beidou-1 ground terminal cost around cn¥20,000rmb (us$2,929), almost 10 times the price of a contemporary gps terminal.
the price of the terminals was explained as being due to the cost of imported microchips.
when all the currently planned gnss systems are deployed, the users will benefit from the use of a total constellation of 75+ satellites, which will significantly improve all the aspects of positioning, especially availability of the signals in so-called urban canyons.
soon after in june 2007, engineers at cnes reported the spectrum and structure of the signals.
during this trial run, compass will offer positioning accuracy to within 25 meters, but the precision will improve as more satellites are launched.
the first satellite of the second-generation system, compass-m1 was launched in 2007.
in all three traditions, a canon was originally a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.
greek kanon / ancient greek: κανών, arabic qanun / قانون, hebrew kaneh / קנה, "straight"; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is "reed" (cf.
the apostolic canons or ecclesiastical canons of the same holy apostles is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the eastern, fifty in the western church) concerning the government and discipline of the early christian church, incorporated with the apostolic constitutions which are part of the ante-nicene fathers in the fourth century the first council of nicaea (325) calls canons the disciplinary measures of the church: the term canon, κανὠν, means in greek, a rule.
the roman catholic church canon law also includes the main five rites (groups) of churches which are in full union with the roman catholic church and the supreme pontiff:
in the roman church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and promulgation from the office of pope, who as supreme pontiff possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person.
the canon law of the eastern catholic churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the code of canons of the eastern churches promulgated in 1990 by pope john paul ii.
the canon law of the eastern catholic churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the code of canons of the eastern churches promulgated in 1990 by pope john paul ii.
the academic degrees in canon law are the j.c.b. (juris canonici baccalaureatus, bachelor of canon law, normally taken as a graduate degree), j.c.l. (juris canonici licentiatus, licentiate of canon law) and the j.c.d. (juris canonici doctor, doctor of canon law).
the institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of europe, and consequently both modern civil law and common law (legal system) bear the influences of canon law.
their separate status dates back to the 12th century when the normans split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the saxons.
currently, (2004), there are principles of canon law common to the churches within the anglican communion; their existence can be factually established; each province or church contributes through its own legal system to the principles of canon law common within the communion; these principles have a strong persuasive authority and are fundamental to the self-understanding of each of the churches of the communion; these principles have a living force, and contain in themselves the possibility of further development; and the existence of these principles both demonstrates unity and promotes unity within the anglican communion.
in presbyterian and reformed churches, canon law is known as "practice and procedure" or "church order", and includes the church's laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.
roman canon law had been criticized by the presbyterians as early as 1572 in the admonition to parliament.
on march 22, 2012, the somali cabinet unanimously approved the national communications act, which paves the way for the establishment of a national communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors.
the somali postal service (somali post) is the national postal service of the federal government of somalia.
the government's overall reconstruction plan for somali post is structured into three phases spread out over a period of ten years.
radio gaalkacyo, formerly known as radio free somalia, operates from galkayo in the north-central mudug province.
the mogadishu-based somali national television is the principal national public service broadcaster.
the number of mobile subscribers is similarly expected to rise from 512,682 in 2008 to around 6.1 million by 2015.
there were also 22 established isps and 234 cyber cafes, with an annual growth rate of 15.6%.
catalan evolved from vulgar latin around the eastern pyrenees in the 9th century.
catalan evolved from vulgar latin around the eastern pyrenees in the 9th century.
there is no parallel in europe of such a large, bilingual, non-state speech community.
they are divided into two blocks, eastern and western, differing mostly in pronunciation.
catalan shares many traits with its neighboring romance languages.
in terms of pronunciation, catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other romance languages.
in english, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as catelaner, followed in the 15th century as catellain (from french).
since the spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), catalan has been institutionalizated as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige.
since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several andorranization policies have been enforced, like catalan medium education.
in northern catalonia, catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of france, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004).
for example, catalan fang "mud" and rostir "to roast", of germanic origin, contrast with spanish lodo and asar, of latin origin; whereas catalan filosa "spinning wheel" and pols "temple", of latin origin, contrast with spanish rueca and sien, of germanic origin.
thus, catalan alfàbia "large earthenware jar" and rajola "tile", of arabic origin, contrast with spanish tinaja and teja, of latin origin; whereas catalan oli "oil" and oliva "olive", of latin origin, contrast with spanish aceite and aceituna.
situated between two large linguistic blocks (ibero-romance and gallo-romance), catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar "to miss somebody", apaivagar "to calm down somebody", or rebutjar "reject".
these territories are sometimes referred to as the països catalans (catalan countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status.
catalan has inherited the typical vowel system of vulgar latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a ɛ e i ɔ o u/, a common feature in western romance, except spanish.
balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.
mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%.
in eastern catalan (except majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a e ɛ/ > [ə]; /o ɔ u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct.
in majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a e ɛ/ follow the eastern catalan reduction pattern; however /o ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in western catalan.
in western catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e ɛ/ > [e]; /o ɔ/ > [o]; /a u i/ remain distinct.
e.g. parle, tem, sent (valencian); parlo, temo, sento (northwestern).
any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism.
any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism.
other divergences include the use of ⟨tl⟩ (avl) in some words instead of ⟨tll⟩ like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in valencian, and some of these common in the rest of western catalan too, like subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('i buy').
this clash of opinions has sparked much controversy.
despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of catalan (eastern and western) show some differences in word choices.
despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of catalan (eastern and western) show some differences in word choices.
however, from the 19th century onwards, there is a tendency of favoring words of northern dialects in detriment of others, even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice.

many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [əˈlɛktrik] ("electrical") vs. electricitat [ələktrisiˈtat].
in gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to portuguese, spanish or italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o.
as in the other western romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely.
the morphology of catalan personal pronouns is complex, specially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in spanish or 9 in italian).
this feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.
vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion.
the law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the catalan conjunction i ("and").
the city proper covers 48 square miles (124 km2) with an estimated population of 655,884 in 2014, making it the largest city in new england and the 24th largest city in the united states.
one of the oldest cities in the united states, boston was founded on the shawmut peninsula in 1630 by puritan settlers from england.
its rich history attracts many tourists, with faneuil hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year.
in 1629, the massachusetts bay colony's first governor, john winthrop, led the signing of the cambridge agreement, a key founding document of the city.

the embargo act of 1807, adopted during the napoleonic wars, and the war of 1812 significantly curtailed boston's harbor activity.
during this period boston flourished culturally as well, admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage, with members of old boston families—eventually dubbed boston brahmins—coming to be regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites.
in the 1820s, boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of european immigrants.
on april 15, 2013, two chechen islamist brothers exploded two bombs near the finish line of the boston marathon, killing three people and injuring roughly 264.
boston's coastal location on the north atlantic moderates its temperature, but makes the city very prone to nor'easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain.
fog is fairly common, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and early autumn.
in the city, the population was spread out with 21.9% at age 19 and under, 14.3% from 20 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

there are several major annual events such as first night, which occurs on new year's eve, the boston early music festival, the annual boston arts festival at christopher columbus waterfront park, and italian summer feasts in the north end honoring catholic saints.
because of the city's prominent role in the american revolution, several historic sites relating to that period are preserved as part of the boston national historical park.
the boston athenaeum (one of the oldest independent libraries in the united states), boston children's museum, bull & finch pub (whose building is known from the television show cheers), museum of science, and the new england aquarium are within the city.
while they have played in suburban foxborough since 1971, the new england patriots of the national football league were founded in 1960 as the boston patriots, changing their name after relocating.
along with the adjacent boston public garden, it is part of the emerald necklace, a string of parks designed by frederick law olmsted to encircle the city.
parkscore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes the city's median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.
the city has several federal facilities, including the john f. kennedy federal office building, the thomas p. o'neill federal building, the united states court of appeals for the first circuit, the united states district court for the district of massachusetts, and the federal reserve bank of boston.

based on the latham loop used in cameras and projectors, along with other patents, the trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition, and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution.
in 1910, he promoted florence lawrence, formerly known as "the biograph girl", and actor king baggot, in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing.
in the early years, universal had a "clean picture" policy.
however, by april 1927, carl laemmle considered this to be a mistake as "unclean pictures" from other studios were generating more profit while universal was losing money.
being known around the studios as "uncle carl."
made his son, carl, jr. head of universal pictures as a 21st birthday present.
his early efforts included the critically mauled part-talkie version of edna ferber's novel show boat (1929), the lavish musical broadway (1929) which included technicolor sequences; and the first all-color musical feature (for universal), king of jazz (1930).
the theater chain was scrapped, but carl, jr. held fast to distribution, studio and production operations.
the end for the laemmles came with a lavish version of show boat (1936), a remake of its earlier 1929 part-talkie production, and produced as a high-quality, big-budget film rather than as a b-picture.
the studio fostered many series: the dead end kids and little tough guys action features and serials (1938–43); the comic adventures of infant baby sandy (1938–41); comedies with hugh herbert (1938–42) and the ritz brothers (1940–43); musicals with robert paige, jane frazee, the andrews sisters, and the merry macs (1938–45); and westerns with tom mix (1932–33), buck jones (1933–36), bob baker (1938–39), johnny mack brown (1938–43); rod cameron (1944–45), and kirby grant (1946–47).

during the war years universal did have a co-production arrangement with producer walter wanger and his partner, director fritz lang, lending the studio some amount of prestige productions.
basil rathbone and nigel bruce in new sherlock holmes mysteries (1942–46), teenage musicals with gloria jean, donald o'connor, and peggy ryan (1942–43), and screen adaptations of radio's inner sanctum mysteries with lon chaney, jr. (1943–45).
universal-international became responsible for the american distribution of rank's british productions, including such classics as david lean's great expectations (1946) and laurence olivier's hamlet (1948).
at this time, hal b. wallis, who had latterly worked as a major producer at paramount, moved over to universal, where he produced several films, among them a lavish version of maxwell anderson's anne of the thousand days (1969), and the equally lavish mary, queen of scots (1971).
anxious to expand the company's broadcast and cable presence, longtime mca head lew wasserman sought a rich partner.
universal pictures and studiocanal also co-produced several films, such as love actually (an $40 million-budgeted film that eventually grossed $246 million worldwide).
except for the two first films it produced, claude chabrol's le scandale (english title the champagne murders) and romain gary's les oiseaux vont mourir au pérou (english title birds in peru), it was only involved in french or other european co-productions, the most noticeable ones being louis malle's lacombe, lucien, bertrand blier's les valseuses (english title going places), and fred zinnemann's the day of the jackal.

one distinctive feature that has caused a great amount of interest among linguists is what is traditionally seen as three degrees of phonemic length: short, long, and "overlong", such that /sɑdɑ/, /sɑˑdɑ/ and /sɑːdɑ/ are distinct.
the earliest extant samples of connected (north) estonian are the so-called kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528.
his birthday on march 14 is celebrated in estonia as the mother tongue day.

when estonia was invaded and occupied by the soviet union in world war ii, the status of the estonian language changed to the first of two official languages (russian being the other one).
estonian went back to being the only state language in estonia which in practice meant that use of estonian was promoted while the use of russian was discouraged.
the estonian dialects are divided into two groups – the northern and southern dialects, historically associated with the cities of tallinn in the north and tartu in the south, in addition to a distinct kirderanniku dialect, that of the northeastern coast of estonia.
it should be noted that estonian words and names quoted in international publications from soviet sources are often back-transliterations from the russian transliteration.
in estonian, nouns and pronouns do not have grammatical gender, but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: nominative, genitive, partitive, illative, inessive, elative, allative, adessive, ablative, translative, terminative, essive, abessive, and comitative, with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form).
the direct object of the verb appears either in the accusative (for total objects) or in the partitive (for partial objects).
often 'b' & 'p' are interchangeable, for example 'baggage' becomes 'pagas', 'lob' (to throw) becomes 'loopima'.
estonian language planners such as ado grenzstein (a journalist active in estonia in the 1870s–90s) tried to use formation ex nihilo, urschöpfung; i.e. they created new words out of nothing.
in aavik’s dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created ex nihilo, many of which are in common use today.
its knowledge and uses spread from china through the middle east to medieval europe in the 13th century, where the first water powered paper mills were built.
the pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.
besides the fibres, pulps may contain fillers such as chalk or china clay, which improve its characteristics for printing or writing.
the thickness of paper is often measured by caliper, which is typically given in thousandths of an inch in the united states and in thousandths of a mm in the rest of the world.

cover stock is generally 68 lb, and 110 lb or more is considered card stock.
printing paper is generally between 60 g and 120 g. anything heavier than 160 g is considered card.
mechanical pulping yields almost a tonne of pulp per tonne of dry wood used, which is why mechanical pulps are sometimes referred to as "high yield" pulps.
paper waste accounts for up to 40% of total waste produced in the united states each year, which adds up to 71.6 million tons of paper waste per year in the united states alone.
it is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music.
the electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched.
adult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s easy listening format, which adopted a 70-80% instrumental - 20-30% vocal mix.
some stations would also occasionally play earlier big band-era recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s.
whereas most easy listening music was instrumental, created by relatively unknown artists, and rarely purchased, ac was an attempt to create a similar "lite" format by choosing certain tracks (both hit singles and album cuts) of popular artists.
the hot 100 and easy listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid-1970s, when the texture of much of the music played on top 40 radio once more began to soften.
radio stations played top 40 hits regardless of genre; although, most were in the same genre until the mid-1970s when different forms of popular music started to target different demographic groups, such as disco vs. hard rock.
easy listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres, such as rock and roll or r&b. in addition, several early disco songs, did well on the adult contemporary format.

no song spent more than six weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing that feat.
another format, rhythmic ac, in addition to playing all the popular hot and soft ac music, past and present, places a heavy emphasis on disco as well as 1980s and 1990s dance hits, such as those by amber, c&c music factory and black box, and includes dance remixes of pop songs, such as the soul solution mix of toni braxton's "unbreak my heart".
adult contemporary has long characterized itself as family-friendly, but edited versions of "perfect" by p!nk and "forget you" by cee lo green showed up in the format in 2011.
since the mid-2000s, the mainstreaming of bands like wilco and feist have pushed indie rock into the adult contemporary conversation.
other popular names for the format include "warm", "sunny", "bee" (or "b") and (particularly in canada) "ez rock".
many stations in the soft ac format capitalize on its appeal to office workers (many of them females aged 25–54, a key advertiser demographic), and brand themselves as stations "everyone at work can agree on" (kost originated that phrase as a primary tagline, and other soft ac stations have followed suit).
soft ac includes a larger amount of older music, especially classic r&b, soul, and 1960s and 1970s music, than hot ac.
the soft ac format may soon be facing the demographic pressures that the jazz and big band formats faced in the 1960s and 1970s and that the oldies format is starting to face today, with the result that one may hear soft ac less on over-the-air radio and more on satellite radio systems in coming years.
in 1997, mike marino of kmxb in las vegas described the format as reaching "an audience that has outgrown the edgier hip-hop or alternative music but hasn't gotten old and sappy enough for the soft acs."
a format called quiet storm is often included in urban adult contemporary, and is often played during the evening, blending the urban ac and soft ac styles of music.
in recent years, the smooth jazz format has been renamed to smooth ac, as an attempt to lure younger listeners.
adult contemporary r&b may be played on both soft ac stations and urban ac.
it is a form of neo soul r&b that places emphasis on songcraft and sophistication.
as the use of drum machines, synthesizers, and sequencers dominates r&b-rooted music, adult contemporary r&b tends to take most of its cues from the more refined strains of 1970s soul, such as smooth soul, philly soul and quiet storm.

daylight saving time (dst) or summer time is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months by one hour so that in the evening daylight is experienced an hour longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.
putting clocks forward benefits retailing, sports, and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours, but can cause problems for evening entertainment and for other activities tied to sunlight, such as farming.
in contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the earth's axial tilt.
by synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time (one hour "fast"), individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities.

however, this soon changed as rail and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in franklin's day.
starting on 30 april 1916, germany and its world war i ally austria-hungary were the first to use dst (german: sommerzeit) as a way to conserve coal during wartime.
some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern brazil observes it while equatorial brazil does not.
the us's 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and dst was established in 1918.
only a few us cities retained dst locally thereafter, including new york so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with london, and chicago and cleveland to keep pace with new york.
in the mid-1980s, clorox (parent of kingsford charcoal) and 7-eleven provided the primary funding for the daylight saving time coalition behind the 1987 extension to us dst, and both idaho senators voted for it based on the premise that during dst fast-food restaurants sell more french fries, which are made from idaho potatoes.
in some muslim countries dst is temporarily abandoned during ramadan (the month when no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the dst would delay the evening dinner.
some areas may adopt dst simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.
the 2008 doe report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 united states extension of dst.
in 1984, fortune magazine estimated that a seven-week extension of dst would yield an additional $30 million for 7-eleven stores, and the national golf foundation estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $200 million to $300 million.
although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on us stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology.
in the 1970s the us law enforcement assistance administration (leaa) found a reduction of 10% to 13% in washington, d.c.'s violent crime rate during dst.
effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks.
people who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple dst rules, as not all locations observe dst or observe it the same way.
dst inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time.
continental europe uses similar phrases, such as sommerzeit in germany, zomertijd in dutch-speaking regions, kesäaika in finland, horario de verano or hora de verano in spain and heure d'été in france, whereas in italy the term is ora legale, that is, legal time (legally enforced time) as opposed to "ora solare", solar time, in winter.
some applications standardize on utc to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences.
in unix-like systems the tz environment variable specifies the location name, as in tz=':america/new_york'.
windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years.
this approach is a problem even in windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting.
a move to "permanent daylight saving time" (staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts) is sometimes advocated, and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as argentina, chile, iceland, singapore, uzbekistan and belarus.
however, many remain unconvinced of the benefits, citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round dst entails.

double daylight saving time has been used on occasion; for example, it was used in some european countries during and shortly after world war ii when it was referred to as "double summer time".

the term dialect (from latin dialectus, dialectos, from the ancient greek word διάλεκτος diálektos, "discourse", from διά diá, "through" and λέγω legō, "i speak") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena.
the term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class.
a dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody).
this creole is spoken in the caribbean coast of costa rica (central america) by descendant of jamaican people.
however, this definition becomes problematic in the case of dialect continua, in which it may be the case that dialect b is mutually intelligible with both dialect a and dialect c but dialects a and c are not mutually intelligible with each other.
the status of "language" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development.
due to eastern lombard's status as a gallo-italic language, an eastern lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a occitan, catalan, or french speaker than a standard italian or sicilian language speaker.
modern standard italian itself is heavily based on the latin-derived florentine tuscan language.
with the unification of italy in the 1860s, standard italian became the official national language of the new italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of italy gradually became regarded as subordinate "dialects" to italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism.
officially, north african countries prefer to give preference to the literary arabic and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to islam), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because literary arabic is the liturgical language of islam and the language of the islamic sacred book, the qur'an.
in tunisia, algeria, and morocco, the darijas (spoken north african languages) are sometimes considered more different from other arabic dialects.
in the 19th century, the tsarist government of the russian empire claimed that ukrainian was merely a dialect of russian and not a language on its own.

treaties can be loosely compared to contracts: both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law.
a treaty is an official, express written agreement that states use to legally bind themselves.
if the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted, and is followed by a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.
the signatures of the parties' representatives follow at the very end.
reservations are essentially caveats to a state's acceptance of a treaty.
reservations are essentially caveats to a state's acceptance of a treaty.
if the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other.
there are three ways an existing treaty can be amended.
when determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon.
the re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty.
in international law and international relations, a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement.
this factor has been at work with respect to discussions between north korea and the united states over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation.
the terminology can also be confusing because a treaty may and usually is named something other than a treaty, such as a convention, protocol, or simply agreement.
as obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification.

despite this suppression, much of maspok's demands were later realized with the new constitution, heavily backed by tito himself against opposition from the serbian branch of the party.[citation needed] on 16 may 1974, the new constitution was passed, and the aging tito was named president for life, a status which he would enjoy for five years.
after the constitutional changes of 1974, tito began reducing his role in the day-to-day running of the state.
in 1978, tito traveled to the u.s. during the visit strict security was imposed in washington, d.c. owing to protests by anti-communist croat, serb and albanian groups.
his left leg was amputated soon afterward due to arterial blockages and he died of gangrene at the medical centre ljubljana on 4 may 1980 at 15:05, three days short of his 88th birthday.
the actual mausoleum is called house of flowers (kuća cveća) and numerous people visit the place as a shrine to "better times".
several of these places have since returned to their original names, such as podgorica, formerly titograd (though podgorica's international airport is still identified by the code tgd), and užice, formerly titovo užice, which reverted to its original name in 1992.
in may 1941, she gave birth to their son, aleksandar "mišo" broz.
all throughout his relationship with haas, tito had maintained a promiscuous life and had a parallel relationship with davorjanka paunović, who, under the codename "zdenka", served as a courier in the resistance and subsequently became his personal secretary.
the last time haas saw broz was in 1946.
the brijuni islands were the site of the state summer residence from 1949 on.
a biographer also stated that he spoke "serbo-croatian ... russian, czech, slovenian ... german (with a viennese accent) ... understands and reads french and italian ... [and] also speaks kirghiz."
as an adult, he frequently declared that he was an atheist.
the acute accent, present only in croatian dialects, which tito is perfectly pronouncing, is the strongest proof of tito's belonging to kajkavian dialect.
some of the other foreign awards and decorations of josip broz tito include order of merit, order of manuel amador guerrero, order of prince henry, order of independence, order of merit, order of the nile, order of the condor of the andes, order of the star of romania, order of the gold lion of the house of nassau, croix de guerre, order of the cross of grunwald, czechoslovak war cross, decoration of honour for services to the republic of austria, military order of the white lion, nishan-e-pakistan, order of al rafidain, order of carol i, order of georgi dimitrov, order of karl marx, order of manuel amador guerrero, order of michael the brave, order of pahlavi, order of sukhbaatar, order of suvorov, order of the liberator, order of the october revolution, order of the queen of sheba, order of the white rose of finland, partisan cross, royal order of cambodia and star of people's friendship and thiri thudhamma thingaha.[citation needed]
the marshall islands, officially the republic of the marshall islands (marshallese: aolepān aorōkin m̧ajeļ),[note 1] is an island country located near the equator in the pacific ocean, slightly west of the international date line.
about 27,797 of the islanders (at the 2011 census) live on majuro, which contains the capital.
in world war i the empire of japan occupied the marshall islands, which in 1919 the league of nations combined with other former german territories to form the south pacific mandate.
however, spain sold the islands to the german empire in 1884, and they became part of german new guinea in 1885.

with few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a service economy, as well as some fishing and agriculture; aid from the united states represents a large percentage of the islands' gross domestic product.
spanish explorer alonso de salazar was the first european to see the islands in 1526, commanding the ship santa maria de la victoria, the only surviving vessel of the loaísa expedition.

on january 12, they sighted another island at 10°n that they called "corrales" (possibly wotho).
on january 15, the spaniards sighted another low island, perhaps ujelang, at 10°n, where they described the people on "barbudos".
the islands were named for marshall on western charts, although the natives have historically named their home "jolet jen anij" (gifts from god).
in 1834, captain donsette and his crew were killed.
in 1857, two missionaries successfully settled on ebon, living among the natives through at least 1870.:3

after the meiji restoration (1868), the japanese government adopted a policy of turning the japanese empire into a great economic and military power in east asia.
in 1914, japan joined the entente during world war i and captured various german empire colonies, including several in micronesia.
during its years of colonial rule, japan moved more than 1,000 japanese to the marshall islands although they never outnumbered the indigenous peoples as they did in the mariana islands and palau.
in the months before the attack on pearl harbor, kwajalein atoll was the administrative center of the japanese 6th fleet forces service, whose task was the defense of the marshall islands.
during the early years of the cold war from 1946 to 1958, the united states tested 67 nuclear weapons at its pacific proving grounds located in the marshall islands, including the largest atmospheric nuclear test ever conducted by the u.s., code named castle bravo. "
from 1956 to august 1998, at least $759 million was paid to the marshallese islanders in compensation for their exposure to u.s. nuclear weapon testing.
in 2008, extreme waves and high tides caused widespread flooding in the capital city of majuro and other urban centres, 3 feet (0.91 m) above sea level.
de brum proposed a majuro declaration for climate leadership to galvanize concrete action on climate change.
elections are held every four years in universal suffrage (for all citizens above 18), with each of the twenty-four constituencies (see below) electing one or more representatives (senators) to the lower house of rmi's unicameral legislature, the nitijela. (

four of the five marshallese presidents who have been elected since the constitution was adopted in 1979 have been traditional paramount chiefs.
while wake has been administered by the united states since 1899, the marshallese government refers to it by the name enen-kio.
agricultural production is concentrated on small farms.[citation needed] the most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit.[citation needed]
in july 2011, the number of island residents was estimated to number about 72,191.
most of the residents are marshallese, who are of micronesian origin and migrated from asia several thousand years ago.
it gained considerable institutional privileges between 1333 and 1370 during the reign of king casimir iii the great.:211 in 1413, following a series of tentative personal unions between the grand duchy of lithuania and the crown kingdom of poland, the existing lithuanian nobility formally joined this class.:211 as the polish-lithuanian commonwealth (1569–1795) evolved and expanded in territory, its membership grew to include the leaders of ducal prussia, podolian and ruthenian lands.
the notion that all polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional polish saying:
the polish "rycerz" ("knight", cognate of the german "ritter") and the polish "herb" ("coat of arms", from the german "erbe", "heritage").
the polish "rycerz" ("knight", cognate of the german "ritter") and the polish "herb" ("coat of arms", from the german "erbe", "heritage").
some powerful polish nobles were referred to as "magnates" (polish singular: "magnat", plural: "magnaci") and "możny" ("magnate", "oligarch"; plural: "możni"); see magnates of poland and lithuania.
the polish term "szlachta" designated the formalized, hereditary noble class of polish-lithuanian commonwealth.
occasionally, 19th-century non-noble landowners were referred to as szlachta by courtesy or error, when they owned manorial estates though they were not noble by birth.
as some szlachta were poorer than some non-noble gentry, some particularly impoverished szlachta were forced to become tenants of the wealthier gentry.
the polish clan name and cry ritualized the ius militare, i.e., the power to command an army; and they had been used some time before 1244 to define knightly status. (
mieszko i of poland (c. 935 – 25 may 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the lekhitic tribes and preserving the unity of his state.
these możni (magnates) constantly sought to undermine princely authority.:75, 76 in gall anonym's chronicle, there is noted the nobility's alarm when the palatine sieciech "elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born" entrusting them with state offices. (
after the union of horodło the lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with the polish szlachta, and over time began to become more and more polonized, although they did preserve their national consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their lithuanian family roots.
the orthodox nobles' rights were nominally equal to those enjoyed by polish and lithuanian nobility, but there was a cultural pressure to convert to catholicism, that was greatly eased in 1596 by the union of brest.
in the kingdom of poland and later in the polish-lithuanian commonwealth, ennoblement (nobilitacja) may be equated with an individual given legal status as a szlachta (member of the polish nobility).
the newly formed noble families generally took up, as their family names, the lithuanian pagan given names of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the goštautai, radvilos, astikai, kęsgailos and others.
these families were granted their coats of arms under the union of horodlo (1413).
significant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta, as defined by robert bideleux and ian jeffries, consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax, a 1425 guarantee against the 'arbitrary arrests and/or seizure of property' of its members, a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial sejms, and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners.
the law forbade non-nobles from owning nobility-estates and promised the estate to the denouncer.
in 1355 in buda king casimir iii the great issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreement that in the lack of casimir's male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, louis i of hungary.
henceforth no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a warrant from a court of justice: the king could neither punish nor imprison any noble at his whim.
on 23 october 1501, at mielnik polish–lithuanian union was reformed at the union of mielnik (polish: unia mielnicka, unia piotrkowsko-mielnicka).
this forbade the king to pass any new law without the consent of the representatives of the nobility, in sejm and senat assembled, and thus greatly strengthened the nobility's political position.
after his death in 1605, the movement lost its political force.
however, starting from 1573, practically any polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could become a polish–lithuanian monarch.
in 1581 the crown tribunal was joined by a counterpart in lithuania, the lithuanian tribunal.
in theory at least, all polish noblemen were social equals.
note that the polish landed gentry (ziemianie or ziemiaństwo) was composed of any nobility that owned lands: thus of course the magnates, the middle nobility and that lesser nobility that had at least part of the village.
also, most families sharing origin would also share a coat-of-arms.
sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to the clan on the basis of similarity of arms.
also, the tradition of differentiating between the coat of arms proper and a lozenge granted to women did not develop in poland.
he is known for three major works of latin literature, the eclogues (or bucolics), the georgics, and the epic aeneid.
modeled after homer's iliad and odyssey, the aeneid follows the trojan refugee aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of italy—in roman mythology the founding act of rome.
one, the catalepton, consists of fourteen short poems, some of which may be virgil's, and another, a short narrative poem titled the culex ("the gnat"), was attributed to virgil as early as the 1st century ad.
ancient commentators noted that virgil seems to divide the aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the iliad.
lavinia had already been promised to turnus, the king of the rutulians, who is roused to war by the fury allecto, and amata lavinia's mother.
at present the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.
this may be consistent with the theory that in greek alpes is a name of non-indo-european origin (which is common for prominent mountains and mountain ranges in the mediterranean region).
the highest peaks of the western alps and eastern alps, respectively, are mont blanc, at 4,810 m (15,780 ft) and piz bernina at 4,049 metres (13,284 ft).
the highest pass in the alps is the col de l'iseran in savoy (france) at 2,770 m (9,088 ft).
flysch deposits in the southern alps of lombardy probably occurred in the cretaceous or later.
peaks in france, italy and switzerland lie in the "houillière zone", which consists of basement with sediments from the mesozoic era.
while mont blanc was first climbed in 1786, most of the alpine four-thousanders were climbed during the first half of the 19th century; the ascent of the matterhorn in 1865 marked the end of the golden age of alpinism.
in the miocene epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation, which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist louis agassiz who presented a paper proclaiming the alps were covered in ice at various intervals—a theory he formed when studying rocks near his neuchâtel home which he believed originated to the west in the bernese oberland.
agassiz studied glacier movement in the 1840s at the unteraar glacier where he found the glacier moved 100 m (328 ft) per year, more rapidly in the middle than at the edges.
the alps provide lowland europe with drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power.
the severe weather in the alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind.
some of the valleys are quite arid such as the aosta valley in italy, the maurienne in france, the valais in switzerland, and northern tyrol.
above the forestry, there is often a band of short pine trees (pinus mugo), which is in turn superseded by alpenrosen, dwarf shrubs, typically rhododendron ferrugineum (on acid soils) or rhododendron hirsutum (on alkaline soils).
although the alpenrose prefers acidic soil, the plants are found throughout the region.
the alps are a habitat for 30,000 species of wildlife, ranging from the tiniest snow fleas to brown bears, many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro-climates either directly above or below the snow line.

the rock drawings in valcamonica are more than 5000 years old; more than 200,000 drawings and etchings have been identified at the site.
in 1991 a mummy of a neolithic body, known as ötzi the iceman, was discovered by hikers on the similaun glacier.

the raetians lived in the eastern regions, while the west was occupied by the helvetii and the allobrogi settled in the rhone valley and in savoy.
the frankish expansion of the carolingian empire and the bavarian expansion in the eastern alps introduced feudalism and the building of castles to support the growing number of dukedoms and kingdoms.
after a series of battles fought in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century switzerland was well-established as a separate state.
thus, savoy built a series of fortifications in the maurienne valley in order to protect the major alpine passes, such as the col du mont-cenis that was even crossed by, charlemagne and his father to defeat the lombarts.
in 1492 antoine de ville climbed mont aiguille, without reaching the summit, an experience he described as "horrifying and terrifying."
much of the alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and in the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving, baking and pastry-making, and cheesemaking.
the kitchen is separated from the living area (called the stube, the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat.
in the slavic alps alone 19 dialects have been identified.
at present the alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such oberstdorf, in bavaria, saalbach in austria, davos in switzerland, chamonix in france, and cortina d'ampezzo in italy recording more than a million annual visitors.
with over 120 million visitors a year tourism is integral to the alpine economy with much it coming from winter sports although summer visitors are an important component of the tourism industry.
most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene–environment interactions.
these alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits.
gene was coined in 1909 by danish botanist wilhelm johannsen to describe the fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity, while the related word genetics was first used by william bateson in 1905.
an automated version of the sanger method was used in early phases of the human genome project.
the vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of dna (deoxyribonucleic acid).
two chains of dna twist around each other to form a dna double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine.
rna also contains the base uracil in place of thymine.
however, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding dna makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term "junk dna" may be a misnomer.
however, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding dna makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term "junk dna" may be a misnomer.
these include dna regions that are not transcribed as well as untranslated regions of the rna.
promoter regions have a consensus sequence, however highly transcribed genes have "strong" promoter sequences that bind the transcription machinery well, whereas others have "weak" promoters that bind poorly and initiate transcription less frequently.:7.2 eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters.:7.3
the transcribed pre-mrna contains untranslated regions at both ends which contain a ribosome binding site, terminator and start and stop codons.
in addition, most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated.
many prokaryotic genes are organized into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit.
this model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mrnas are concatenated by trans-splicing.
first, the gene's dna is transcribed to messenger rna (mrna).:6.1 second, that mrna is translated to protein.:6.2 rna-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein.
first, the gene's dna is transcribed to messenger rna (mrna).:6.1 second, that mrna is translated to protein.:6.2 rna-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein.
the process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either rna or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.
sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid.:6 additionally, a "start codon", and three "stop codons" indicate the beginning and end of the protein coding region.
transcription is performed by an enzyme called an rna polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the rna from 5' to 3'.
translation is the process by which a mature mrna molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein.:6.2 translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of rna and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds.
genes are regulated so that they are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources.:7 a cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism.
organisms inherit their genes from their parents.
asexual organisms simply inherit a complete copy of their parent's genome.
sexual organisms have two copies of each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent.:1
the closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them.
a gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants.
most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution.
subsequently, the sequencing in the human genome project indicated that many of these transcripts were alternative variants of the same genes, and the total number of protein-coding genes was revised down to ~20,000 with 13 genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome.
for example, genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's function.
however, the genomes of cells in an adult organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases.

physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.
recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways, analogous to the central processing unit (cpu) in a computer.
a single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells.
the essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs.
except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system) and cnidarians (which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net), all living multicellular animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other).
neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata.
neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them—neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell, and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules.
the two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), which is almost always inhibitory.
when large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (eeg) or magnetoencephalography (meg).
in other animals additional senses may be present, such as the infrared heat-sense of snakes, the magnetic field sense of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.
except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.
the scn continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the retinohypothalamic tract (rht), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.
there are two types of sleep: rem sleep (with dreaming) and nrem (non-rem, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode.
during deep nrem sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized.
the ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist claude bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (greek for "standing still").
research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.
psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system.
the oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical, and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes.
at the beginning of the 19th century the ottoman empire included all of the balkan peninsula north to the southern edge of the hungarian plain, but by 1914 had lost all of it except constantinople and eastern thrace to the rise of balkan nationalism, which saw the independence of greece, serbia, the danubian principalities and bulgaria.
it was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the barbary coast, de facto independent since the 18th century.
the demise of the sick man of europe left considerable confusion as to what was to be meant by "near east".
elizabeth i of england, primarily interested in trade with the east, collaborated with english merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions, using their own jargon.
their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty.
the populations of those lands did not accept turkish rule.
the greek war of independence, 1821–1832, created modern greece, which recovered most of the lands of ancient greece, but could not gain constantinople.
the result was the crimean war, 1853–1856, in which the british empire and the french empire supported the ottoman empire in its struggle against the incursions of the russian empire.

in 1894, sir henry norman, 1st baronet, a journalist, travelled to the far east, afterwards writing a book called the peoples and politics of the far east, which came out in 1895.
for his authority miller invokes the people, citing the "collective wisdom" of europe, and introducing a concept to arise many times in the decades to follow under chilling circumstances:
the term middle east as a noun and adjective was common in the 19th century in nearly every context except diplomacy and archaeology.

the ottomans were portrayed as the slavers, but even as the american and british fleets were striking at the barbary pirates on behalf of freedom, their countries were promulgating a vigorous african slave trade of their own.
the term "near and middle east," held the stage for a few years before world war i. it proved to be less acceptable to a colonial point of view that saw the entire region as one.
in 1916 captain t.c. fowle, 40th pathans (troops of british india), wrote of a trip he had taken from karachi to syria just before the war.
although racial and colonial definitions of the middle east are no longer considered ideologically sound, the sentiment of unity persists.
in the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as "near east", "far east" and "middle east" were relegated to the experts, especially in the new field of political science.
within the government the state department has been most influential in promulgating the near eastern regional system.
the library of congress (loc) is an institution established by congress to provide a research library for the government of the united states and serve as a national library.
the ancient near east is a term of the 20th century intended to stabilize the geographical application of near east to ancient history.[citation needed] the near east may acquire varying meanings, but the ancient near east always has the same meaning: the ancient nations, people and languages of the enhanced fertile crescent, a sweep of land from the nile valley through anatolia and southward to the limits of mesopotamia.
the meaning of near east in these numerous establishments and publications is middle east.
shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the shang founder yu the great.

the village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public.
for example, the clan of zhuge liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of shu han from central plain in north china during the three kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village zhuge village (zhege cun), consisting of villagers all with family name "zhuge".
zhejiang, as the heartland of the jiangnan (yangtze river delta), remained the wealthiest area during the six dynasties (220 or 222–589), sui, and tang.
greenware ceramics made from celadon had been made in the area since the 3rd-century jin dynasty, but it returned to prominence—particularly in longquan—during the southern song and yuan.
"in 1727 the to-min or 'idle people' of cheh kiang province (a ningpo name still existing), the yoh-hu or 'music people' of shanxi province, the si-min or 'small people' of kiang su (jiangsu) province, and the tanka people or 'egg-people' of canton (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities, and allowed to count as free men." "
during the first opium war, the british navy defeated eight banners forces at ningbo and dinghai.
in 1876, wenzhou became zhejiang's second treaty port.
during the cultural revolution (1966–76), zhejiang was in chaos and disunity, and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966–69) of the revolution.
zhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources, a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea, and an economic base at the national average.
han chinese make up the vast majority of the population, and the largest han subgroup are the speakers of wu varieties of chinese.
the rapid development of religions in zhejiang has driven the local committee of ethnic and religious affairs to enact measures to rationalise them in 2014, variously named "three rectifications and one demolition" operations or "special treatment work on illegally constructed sites of religious and folk religion activities" according to the locality.
other varieties of chinese are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; mandarin and huizhou dialects are spoken on the border with anhui, while min dialects are spoken on the border with fujian. (
yueju originated in shengzhou and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles.
the mod states that its principal objectives are to defend the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and its interests and to strengthen international peace and stability.
during the 1920s and 1930s, british civil servants and politicians, looking back at the performance of the state during world war i, concluded that there was a need for greater co-ordination between the three services that made up the armed forces of the united kingdom—the british army, the royal navy, and the royal air force.
these departments merged in 1964; the defence functions of the ministry of aviation supply merged into the ministry of defence in 1971.
additionally, there are a number of assistant chiefs of defence staff, including the assistant chief of the defence staff (reserves and cadets) and the defence services secretary in the royal household of the sovereign of the united kingdom, who is also the assistant chief of defence staff (personnel).
the 1998 strategic defence review and the 2003 delivering security in a changing world white paper outlined the following posture for the british armed forces:
dannatt criticised a remnant "cold war mentality", with military expenditures based on retaining a capability against a direct conventional strategic threat; he said currently only 10% of the mod's equipment programme budget between 2003 and 2018 was to be invested in the "land environment"—at a time when britain was engaged in land-based wars in afghanistan and iraq.
according to figures published by the london evening standard the defence budget for 2009 is "more than 10% overspent" (figures cannot be verified) and the paper states that this had caused gordon brown to say that the defence spending must be cut.
the most notable fraud conviction was that of gordon foxley, head of defence procurement at the ministry of defence from 1981 to 1984.
according to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where "more than a million people along the south coast of england, from torquay to the new forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax."
in october 2009, the mod was heavily criticized for withdrawing the bi-annual non-operational training £20m budget for the volunteer territorial army (ta), ending all non-operational training for 6 months until april 2010.
the ta provides a small percentage of the uk's operational troops.
in the beginning of the 21st century, this race has continued with 4k, 5k and current 8k systems.
the baird system was discontinued in february 1937.
the 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 hz frame rate.
colour broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions, first with the us ntsc color system in 1953, which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same 525 lines of resolution.
there were four major hdtv systems tested by smpte in the late 1970s, and in 1979 an smpte study group released a study of high definition television systems:
in 1949, france started its transmissions with an 819 lines system (with 737 active lines).
it was discontinued in 1983.
in 1979, the japanese state broadcaster nhk first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio.
satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of bs-9ch commencing on november 25, 1994, which featured commercial and nhk programming.
in addition, recording and reproducing an hdtv signal was a significant technical challenge in the early years of hdtv (sony hdvs).
in anticipation of these standards the digital video broadcasting (dvb) organisation was formed, an alliance of broadcasters, consumer electronics manufacturers and regulatory bodies.
the dvb develops and agrees upon specifications which are formally standardised by etsi.
one of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame/field refresh rate, the world already having split into two camps, 25/50 hz and 30/60 hz, largely due to the differences in mains frequency.
an aspect ratio of 16:9 was duly agreed upon at the first meeting of the iwp11/6 working party at the bbc's research and development establishment in kingswood warren.
the american advanced television systems committee (atsc) hdtv system had its public launch on october 29, 1998, during the live coverage of astronaut john glenn's return mission to space on board the space shuttle discovery.
test transmissions had been active since the ibc exhibition in september 2003, but the new year's day broadcast marked the official launch of the hd1 channel, and the official start of direct-to-home hdtv in europe.
euro1080 transmissions later changed to mpeg-4/avc compression on a dvb-s2 signal in line with subsequent broadcast channels in europe.
euro1080 transmissions later changed to mpeg-4/avc compression on a dvb-s2 signal in line with subsequent broadcast channels in europe.
despite delays in some countries, the number of european hd channels and viewers has risen steadily since the first hdtv broadcasts, with ses's annual satellite monitor market survey for 2010 reporting more than 200 commercial channels broadcasting in hd from astra satellites, 185 million hd capable tvs sold in europe (£60 million in 2010 alone), and 20 million households (27% of all european digital satellite tv homes) watching hd satellite broadcasts (16 million via astra satellites).
the freeview hd service currently contains 10 hd channels (as of december 2013[update]) and was rolled out region by region across the uk in accordance with the digital switchover process, finally being completed in october 2012.
in the days of standard definition television, the fractional rates were often rounded up to whole numbers, e.g. 23.976p was often called 24p, or 59.94i was often called 60i.
the technical standards for broadcasting hdtv also handle the 16:9 aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or anamorphic stretching, thus increasing the effective image resolution.
the technical standards for broadcasting hdtv also handle the 16:9 aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or anamorphic stretching, thus increasing the effective image resolution.
the optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image's characteristics.
as of july 2004[update], boxes are not included in the fcc mandate.
as an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy.
people have used wood for millennia for many purposes, primarily as a fuel or as a construction material for making houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper.
knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber, this will depend on the size and location.
a knot primer paint or solution, correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.
since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.
the larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness.
as a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings.
in species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above).

it consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40% – 50%) and hemicellulose (15% – 25%) impregnated with lignin (15% – 30%).
in coniferous or softwood species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, tracheids, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods.
there are no vessels ("pores") in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.
the water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by vessels: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others (buckeye, poplar, willow) too small to be seen without a hand lens.
in discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ring-porous and diffuse-porous.
in temperate softwoods there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood.
in the case of the ring-porous hardwoods there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties.
of these, bamboo, botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and, these days, in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer.
age, diameter, height, radial growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, silvicultural treatment, and seed source, all to some degree influence wood density.
approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.
wood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as chipboard, hardboard, and medium-density fiberboard (mdf).
further developments include new lignin glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.
the choice of wood may make a significant difference to the tone and resonant qualities of the instrument, and tonewoods have widely differing properties, ranging from the hard and dense african blackwood (used for the bodies of clarinets) to the light but resonant european spruce (picea abies), which is traditionally used for the soundboards of violins.
for example, cricket bats are typically made of white willow.
the baseball bats which are legal for use in major league baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory, and in recent years have been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat more fragile.
nba courts have been traditionally made out of parquetry.
the ancient puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with pharaonic egypt during the times of pharaoh sahure and queen hatshepsut.
the birth of islam on the opposite side of somalia's red sea coast meant that somali merchants, sailors and expatriates living in the arabian peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted arab muslim trading partners.
the city of mogadishu came to be known as the city of islam, and controlled the east african gold trade for several centuries.
the historian al-umari records that ifat was situated near the red sea coast, and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel.
in the middle ages, several powerful somali empires dominated the regional trade including the ajuran sultanate, which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building, the sultanate of adal, whose general ahmad ibn ibrahim al-ghazi (ahmed gurey) was the first commander to use cannon warfare on the continent during adal's conquest of the ethiopian empire, and the sultanate of the geledi, whose military dominance forced governors of the omani empire north of the city of lamu to pay tribute to the somali sultan ahmed yusuf.
as a result of its successes against the british, the dervish state received support from the ottoman and german empires.
after a quarter of a century of holding the british at bay, the dervishes were finally defeated in 1920, when britain for the first time in africa used airplanes to bomb the dervish capital of taleex.
in 1945, during the potsdam conference, the united nations granted italy trusteeship of italian somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the somali youth league (syl) and other nascent somali political organizations, such as hizbia digil mirifle somali (hdms) and the somali national league (snl) — that somalia achieve independence within ten years.
djibouti finally gained its independence from france in 1977, and hassan gouled aptidon, a somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as djibouti's first president (1977–1991).
on 1 july 1960, the two territories united to form the somali republic, albeit within boundaries drawn up by italy and britain.

to address these concerns, the somali government on its own part subsequently established the ministry of endowment and islamic affairs, under which qur'anic education is now regulated.
so to extend ties of alliance, marriage is often to another ethnic somali from a different clan.
in 1975, the most prominent government reforms regarding family law in a muslim country were set in motion in the somali democratic republic, which put women and men, including husbands and wives, on complete equal footing.
more recently, somali entrepreneurs have established themselves in kenya, investing over $1.5 billion in the somali enclave of eastleigh alone.
one source estimates that there are 7.78 million speakers of somali in somalia itself and 12.65 million speakers globally.
somali dialects are divided into three main groups: northern, benaadir and maay.
northern somali (or northern-central somali) forms the basis for standard somali.
in addition to somali, arabic, which is also an afro-asiatic tongue, is an official national language in both somalia and djibouti.
many somalis speak it due to centuries-old ties with the arab world, the far-reaching influence of the arabic media, and religious education.
the culture of somalia is an amalgamation of traditions developed independently and through interaction with neighbouring and far away civilizations, such as other parts of northeast africa, the arabian peninsula, india and southeast asia.

the army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit.
the byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory, but none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west, byzantine control of most of the western empire could not be sustained; the reconquest of the italian peninsula and mediterranean periphery by justinian (r. 527–565) was the sole, and temporary, exception.
many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents.
the ostrogoths settled in italy in the late 5th century under theoderic (d. 526) and set up a kingdom marked by its co-operation between the italians and the ostrogoths, at least until the last years of theodoric's reign.
the burgundians settled in gaul, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s.
it began gradually, but by the late 540s slavic tribes were in thrace and illyrium, and had defeated an imperial army near adrianople in 551.

the estimated population of europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested.
as much as 90 per cent of the european population remained rural peasants.
instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son.[r] the dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions.[s] castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals.
the clergy was divided into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks.
throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent.
in the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the far east were pioneered, famously described in the travels of marco polo written by one of the traders, marco polo (d. 1324).
they faced a powerful rival in the dukes of normandy, who in 1066 under william the conqueror (duke 1035–1087), conquered england (r. 1066–87) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the middle ages.

during the tumultuous 14th century, disputes within the leadership of the church led to the avignon papacy of 1305–78, also called the "babylonian captivity of the papacy" (a reference to the babylonian captivity of the jews), and then to the great schism, lasting from 1378 to 1418, when there were two and later three rival popes, each supported by several states.
wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later middle ages: lollardy in england and hussitism in bohemia.
during the later middle ages, theologians such as john duns scotus (d. 1308)[ah] and william of ockham (d. c. 1348), led a reaction against scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith.
the lone exception to this trend was in england, where the common law remained pre-eminent.
international gothic was a courtly style that reached much of europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the très riches heures du duc de berry.
others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the middle ages.
or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning.
the word phonology comes from the greek φωνή, phōnḗ, "voice, sound," and the suffix -logy (which is from greek λόγος, lógos, "word, speech, subject of discussion").
more recently, lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, "phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items."
the history of phonology may be traced back to the ashtadhyayi, the sanskrit grammar composed by pāṇini in the 4th century bc.
at one time, [f] and [v], two sounds that have the same place and manner of articulation and differ in voicing only, were allophones of the same phoneme in english, but later came to belong to separate phonemes.
there are also differing ideas as to whether this grouping of sounds is purely a tool for linguistic analysis, or reflects an actual process in the way the human brain processes a language.
in addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning (the phonemes), phonology studies how sounds alternate, i.e. replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme (allomorphs), as well as, for example, syllable structure, stress, feature geometry, accent, and intonation.
phonology also includes topics such as phonotactics (the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language) and phonological alternation (how the pronunciation of a sound changes through the application of phonological rules, sometimes in a given order which can be feeding or bleeding,) as well as prosody, the study of suprasegmentals and topics such as stress and intonation.
the principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones.
in world war ii, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications such as calculating torpedo aiming.
the differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration.
nevertheless, his son, henry babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888.
the first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by sir william thomson in 1872.
the differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by james thomson, the brother of the more famous lord kelvin.

errors in computer programs are called "bugs".
a key component common to all cpus is the program counter, a special memory cell (a register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.
the sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex cpu designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen.
some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision.
they often feature thousands of cpus, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware.
historically, computers evolved from mechanical computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors.
however different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) very quickly.
in the 18th century, the moroccan sultan moulay ismail "the bloodthirsty" (1672–1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his black guard, who coerced the country into submission.
egyptian president anwar sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned nubian sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned egyptian.
due to the patriarchal nature of arab society, arab men, including during the slave trade in north africa, enslaved more black women than men.
he was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave; his mother was fulani and a concubine of his father.
in early 1991, non-arabs of the zaghawa tribe of sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying arab apartheid campaign, segregating arabs and non-arabs (specifically people of sub-saharan african descent).
when it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered coloured or black, the "pencil test" was used.
in 2008, the high court in south africa ruled that chinese south africans who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendants) are to be reclassified as "black people," solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also "disadvantaged" by racial discrimination.
other than by appearance, "coloureds" can usually be distinguished from "blacks" by language.
they also tend to have more european-sounding names than bantu names.
generally in the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries, most of those of visible african descent are still classified and identify as arab, not black.
about 150,000 east african and black people live in israel, amounting to just over 2% of the nation's population.
other blacks slaves were transported to crete, from where they or their descendants later reached the i̇zmir area through the population exchange between greece and turkey in 1923, or indirectly from ayvalık in pursuit of work.
although it is commonly believed locally that "siddi" derives from a word meaning "black", the term is actually derived from "sayyid", the title borne by the captains of the arab vessels that first brought siddi settlers to the area.
there was a brief "black power" movement in sindh in the 1960s and many siddi are proud of and celebrate their african ancestry.
in isidore’s day, moors were black by definition…"
according to the office for national statistics, at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the united kingdom; 1% of the total population described themselves as "black caribbean", 0.8% as "black african", and 0.2% as "black other".
britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the caribbean after world war ii; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the empire windrush.
as african states became independent in the 1960s, the soviet union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in russia.
various state-based aboriginal protection boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of indigenous australians – where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents.
this nationwide acceptance and recognition of aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as aboriginal or torres strait islander.
in 2012, a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as aboriginal or torres strait islander is not dependent on skin colour, with a well-known boxer anthony mundine being widely criticised for questioning the "blackness" of another boxer and journalist andrew bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about aboriginals with light skin.

in 1988, the civil rights leader jesse jackson urged americans to use instead the term "african american" because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by european descendants, such as german american, italian american, etc.
the census bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.
this practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century.
an indentured servant, he was "bound for life" in 1640 after trying to escape.
brazil has the largest population of afro-descendants outside of africa.
by the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from europe and asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white.
the city of salvador, bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color.
journalists like to say that us cities with black majorities, such as detroit and new orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the voting rights act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the south regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century.
new orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of hurricane katrina in 2005.
this proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people, such as caboclos (mestizos), assimilated amerindians and tri-racials, not only people of partial african and european descent.
the times is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, including the times of india (founded in 1838), the straits times (singapore) (1845), the new york times (1851), the irish times (1859), le temps (france) (1861-1942), the cape times (south africa) (1872), the los angeles times (1881), the seattle times (1891), the manila times (1898), the daily times (malawi) (1900), el tiempo (colombia) (1911), the canberra times (1926), and the times (malta) (1935).
the times is the originator of the widely used times roman typeface, originally developed by stanley morison of the times in collaboration with the monotype corporation for its legibility in low-tech printing.
the times had an average daily circulation of 394,448 in march 2014; in the same period, the sunday times had an average daily circulation of 839,077.
a complete historical file of the digitized paper is online from gage cengage publisher.
the first publication of the newspaper the daily universal register in great britain was 1 january 1785.
beginning in 1814, the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by friedrich koenig.
in other events of the nineteenth century, the times opposed the repeal of the corn laws until the number of demonstrations convinced the editorial board otherwise, and only reluctantly supported aid to victims of the irish potato famine.
during his tenure (1890–1911), the times became associated with selling the encyclopædia britannica using aggressive american marketing methods introduced by horace everett hooper and his advertising executive, henry haxton.
in 1922, john jacob astor, son of the 1st viscount astor, bought the times from the northcliffe estate.
in 1922, john jacob astor, son of the 1st viscount astor, bought the times from the northcliffe estate.
in 1967, members of the astor family sold the paper to canadian publishing magnate roy thomson.
in may 2008 printing of the times switched from wapping to new plants at broxbourne on the outskirts of london, and merseyside and glasgow, enabling the paper to be produced with full colour on every page for the first time.
the times current prices are £1.20 for the daily edition and £1.50 for the saturday edition.
these supplements were relaunched in january 2009 as: sport, weekend (including travel and lifestyle features), saturday review (arts, books, and ideas), the times magazine (columns on various topics), and playlist (an entertainment listings guide).
notable contributors include giles coren, food and drink writer of the year in 2005 and nadiya hussain, winner of bbc's the great british bake off.

on 12 december 1911, during the delhi durbar, george v, then emperor of india, along with queen mary, his consort, made the announcement that the capital of the raj was to be shifted from calcutta to delhi, while laying the foundation stone for the viceroy's residence in the coronation park, kingsway camp.
however, it was rejected by the viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high.
eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the north side, the committee settled on the south site.
before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of raisina hill, a circular railway line around the council house (now parliament house), called the imperial delhi railway, was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years.
after the capital of india moved to delhi, a temporary secretariat building was constructed in a few months in 1912 in north delhi.
most of the government offices of the new capital moved here from the 'old secretariat' in old delhi (the building now houses the delhi legislative assembly), a decade before the new capital was inaugurated in 1931.
built in the 1940s, to house government employees, with bungalows for senior officials in the nearby lodhi estate area, lodhi colony near historic lodhi gardens, was the last residential areas built by the british raj.

migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food.
the arctic tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between arctic breeding grounds and the antarctic each year.
aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the nile.
many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes), and many show the alternative, chain migration, where populations 'slide' more evenly north and south without reversing order.
the same considerations about barriers and detours that apply to long-distance land-bird migration apply to water birds, but in reverse: a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites may also be a barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters.
for some species of waders, migration success depends on the availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route.
the most pelagic species, mainly in the 'tubenose' order procellariiformes, are great wanderers, and the albatrosses of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the "roaring forties" outside the breeding season.
as they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking manx shearwater is calculated to have flown 8 million km (5 million miles) during its over-50 year lifespan.
bohemian waxwings bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000.
the primary physiological cue for migration are the changes in the day length.
the ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps.
there is a neural connection between the eye and "cluster n", the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually be able to see the magnetic field of the earth.

at this stage the bird is in the position of a boy scout with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use.
reverse migration, where the genetic programming of young birds fails to work properly, can lead to rarities turning up as vagrants thousands of kilometres out of range.

it charts, measures, and contextualizes the: physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo.
it studies the relationship between the body systems, pathogens, and immunity.
the latter is further divided into humoral (or antibody) and cell-mediated components.
the study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the immune system, including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology.
immunology rests on an understanding of the properties of these two biological entities and the cellular response to both.
other immune system disorders include various hypersensitivities (such as in asthma and other allergies) that respond inappropriately to otherwise harmless compounds.
neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed.
during adolescence, the human body undergoes various physical, physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones, of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol (an oestrogen) and, in males, is testosterone.
immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude.
on the basis of cst, burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: "self" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while "nonself" entities (e.g., pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response.
the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex "two-signal" activation of t cells.
immunology is a branch of bioscience for undergraduate programs but the major gets specified as students move on for graduate program in immunology.
the introductory course is a course that gives students an overview of the basics of immunology.
a master’s degree requires two years of study following the attainment of a bachelor's degree.
the compression works by reducing the accuracy of certain parts of a sound that are considered to be beyond the auditory resolution ability of most people.
mp3 was designed by the moving picture experts group (mpeg) as part of its mpeg-1 standard and later extended in the mpeg-2 standard.
this work added to a variety of reports from authors dating back to fletcher, and to the work that initially determined critical ratios and critical bandwidths.
much of its technology and ideas were incorporated into the definition of iso mpeg audio layer i and layer ii and the filter bank alone into layer iii (mp3) format as part of the computationally inefficient hybrid filter bank.
further work on mpeg audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of mpeg standards, mpeg-2, more formally known as international standard iso/iec 13818-3 (a.k.a.
a reference simulation software implementation, written in the c language and later known as iso 11172-5, was developed (in 1991–1996) by the members of the iso mpeg audio committee in order to produce bit compliant mpeg audio files (layer 1, layer 2, layer 3).
it was approved as a committee draft of iso/iec technical report in march 1994 and printed as document cd 11172-5 in april 1994.
because of the relatively small hard drives back in that time (~ 500–1000 mb) lossy compression was essential to store non-instrument based (see tracker and midi) music for playback on computer.
as sound scholar jonathan sterne notes, "an australian hacker acquired l3enc using a stolen credit card.
an mp3 file is made up of mp3 frames, which consist of a header and a data block.
the mpeg-1 standard does not include a precise specification for an mp3 encoder, but does provide example psychoacoustic models, rate loop, and the like in the non-normative part of the original standard.
additionally, the combining of the two filter banks' outputs creates aliasing problems that must be handled partially by the "aliasing compensation" stage; however, that creates excess energy to be coded in the frequency domain, thereby decreasing coding efficiency.[citation needed]
encoder / decoder overall delay is not defined, which means there is no official provision for gapless playback.
when performing lossy audio encoding, such as creating an mp3 file, there is a trade-off between the amount of space used and the sound quality of the result.
besides the bit rate of an encoded piece of audio, the quality of mp3 files also depends on the quality of the encoder itself, and the difficulty of the signal being encoded.
the idea behind this is that, in any piece of audio, some parts will be much easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few instruments, while others will be more difficult to compress.
a test given to new students by stanford university music professor jonathan berger showed that student preference for mp3-quality music has risen each year.
uncompressed audio as stored on an audio-cd has a bit rate of 1,411.2 kbit/s, (16 bit/sample × 44100 samples/second × 2 channels / 1000 bits/kilobit), so the bitrates 128, 160 and 192 kbit/s represent compression ratios of approximately 11:1, 9:1 and 7:1 respectively.
average bitrate is vbr implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes.
layer iii audio can also use a "bit reservoir", a partially full frame's ability to hold part of the next frame's audio data, allowing temporary changes in effective bitrate, even in a constant bitrate stream.
layer iii audio can also use a "bit reservoir", a partially full frame's ability to hold part of the next frame's audio data, allowing temporary changes in effective bitrate, even in a constant bitrate stream.
internal handling of the bit reservoir increases encoding delay.[citation needed]
a "tag" in an audio file is a section of the file that contains metadata such as the title, artist, album, track number or other information about the file's contents.
a. and its u.s. subsidiary audio mpeg, inc. previously sued thomson for patent infringement on mp3 technology, but those disputes were resolved in november 2005 with sisvel granting thomson a license to their patents.
sisvel s.p.
in february 2007, texas mp3 technologies sued apple, samsung electronics and sandisk in eastern texas federal court, claiming infringement of a portable mp3 player patent that texas mp3 said it had been assigned.
alcatel-lucent has asserted several mp3 coding and compression patents, allegedly inherited from at&t-bell labs, in litigation of its own.
besides lossy compression methods, lossless formats are a significant alternative to mp3 because they provide unaltered audio content, though with an increased file size compared to lossy compression.
house music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in chicago in the early 1980s.
early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines.
as of 2015, house music remains extremely popular in both clubs and in the mainstream pop scene while retaining a foothold on underground scenes across the globe.[citation needed]
the electronic instrumentation and minimal arrangement of charanjit singh's synthesizing: ten ragas to a disco beat (1982), an album of indian ragas performed in a disco style, anticipated the sounds of acid house music, but it is not known to have had any influence on the genre prior to the album's rediscovery in the 21st century.
these homegrown productions were played on chicago-area radio and in local discothèques catering mainly to african-american and gay audiences.
by 1986, uk labels were releasing house music by chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by chicago djs and producers were appearing on and topping the uk music chart.
the term "house music" is said to have originated from a chicago club called the warehouse, which existed from 1977 to 1983.
clubbers to the warehouse were primarily black and gay, who came to dance to music played by the club's resident dj frankie knuckles, whom fans refer to as the "godfather of house".
frankie knuckles, or the warehouse by name, but agrees that "house" was a regional catch-all term for dance music, and that it was once synonymous with older disco music.
larry heard, a.k.a. "
mr. fingers", claims that the term "house" became popular due to many of the early djs creating music in their own homes using synthesizers and drum machines such as the roland tr-808, tr-909, and the tb 303.[citation needed] these synthesizers were used to create a house subgenre called acid house.
frankie knuckles once said that the warehouse club in chicago was like "church for people who have fallen from grace" the house producer marshall jefferson compared it to "old-time religion in the way that people just get happy and screamin'".
this sound, also influenced by european electronica (kraftwerk, art of noise), japanese synthpop (yellow magic orchestra), early b-boy hip-hop (man parrish, soul sonic force) and italo disco (doctor's cat, ris, klein m.b.o.), was further pioneered by juan atkins, derrick may, and kevin saunderson, the "godfathers" of detroit techno.[citation needed]

pop recording artist madonna's 1990 single "vogue" became an international hit single and topped the us charts.
influential gospel/r&b-influenced aly-us released "time passes on" in 1993 (strictly rhythm), then later, "follow me" which received radio airplay as well as being played in clubs.
by the early 1990s artists such as cajmere himself (under that name as well as green velvet and as producer for dajae), dj sneak, glenn underground and others did many recordings.
the 'chilling out' concept developed in britain with ambient house albums such as the klf's chill out and analogue bubblebath by aphex twin.
towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, producers such as daft punk, stardust, cassius, st. germain and dj falcon began producing a new sound out of paris's house scene.
numerous live performance events dedicated to house music were founded during the course of the decade, including shambhala music festival and major industry sponsored events like miami's winter music conference.
sweden knew a prominence of snare-less "swedish progressive house" with the emergence of sebastian ingrosso, axwell, steve angello (these three formed a trio called swedish house mafia), avicii, alesso, etc.

pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns musical tones to relative positions on a musical scale based primarily on their perception of the frequency of vibration.
pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent.
since pitch is such a close proxy for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or amplitude, of the wave.
that is, "high" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and "low" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation.

the concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works.
both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition.
these others may be benign - such that one aspires to their characteristics, values and beliefs (a process of idealistic-identification), or malign - when one wishes to dissociate from their characteristics (a process of defensive contra-identification) (weinreich & saunderson 2003, chapter 1, pp 54–61).
some scholars have introduced the idea of identification, whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified' and interpreted by individuals.
in cognitive psychology, the term "identity" refers to the capacity for self-reflection and the awareness of self.(leary & tangney 2003, p. 3)

in later years it was rav ettlinger's students rabbi samson raphael hirsch and rabbi azriel hildesheimer of berlin who deepened the awareness and strength of orthodox jewry.
the ashkenazi prohibition against eating kitniyot (grains and legumes such as rice, corn, beans, and peanuts) during passover was explicitly rejected in the talmud, has no known precedent before the 12th century and represented a minority position for hundreds of years thereafter, but nonetheless has remained a mandatory prohibition among ashkenazi orthodox jews due to their historic adherence to the rema's rulings in the shulchan aruch.
orthodox judaism maintains the historical understanding of jewish identity.
another phenomenon that sets hasidic judaism apart from general haredi judaism is the strong emphasis placed on speaking yiddish; in (many) hasidic households and communities, yiddish is spoken exclusively.
among orthodox jews, the fertility rate stands at about 4.1 children per family, as compared to 1.9 children per family among non-orthodox jews, and intermarriage among orthodox jews is practically non-existent, standing at about 2%, in contrast to a 71% intermarriage rate among non-orthodox jews.
it also practices involvement with non-orthodox jews that extends beyond "outreach (kiruv)" to continued institutional relations and cooperation; see further under torah umadda.
other "core beliefs" are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies, a commitment to equality of education for both men and women, and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one's family.
they rejected claims of the absolute divine authorship of the torah, declaring only biblical laws concerning ethics to be binding, and stated that the rest of halakha (jewish law) need not be viewed as normative for jews in wider society. (
generally speaking, of the three key strands of orthodox judaism, haredi orthodox and hasidic orthodox jews are at best ambivalent towards the ideology of zionism and the creation of the state of israel, and there are many groups and organisations who are outspokenly anti-zionistic, seeing the ideology of zionism as diametrically opposed to the teaching of the torah, and the zionist administration of the state of israel, with its emphasis on militarism and nationalism, as destructive of the judaic way of life.
the orthodox jewish movements consider all non-orthodox jewish movements to be unacceptable deviations from authentic judaism; both because of other denominations' doubt concerning the verbal revelation of written and oral torah, and because of their rejection of halakhic precedent as binding.
the orthodox jewish movements consider all non-orthodox jewish movements to be unacceptable deviations from authentic judaism; both because of other denominations' doubt concerning the verbal revelation of written and oral torah, and because of their rejection of halakhic precedent as binding.

in contrast, other multicellular organisms, like plants and fungi, have cells held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.
predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey.
it can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse.
among the other phyla, the ctenophora and the cnidaria, which includes sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus.
the tiny placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber.
animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.
all these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages.
the lophotrochozoa, evolved within protostomia, include two of the most successful animal phyla, the mollusca and annelida.
the former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches.
the lophotrochozoa also include the nemertea or ribbon worms, the sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore.
several animal phyla are recognized for their lack of bilateral symmetry, and are thought to have diverged from other animals early in evolution.
in most protostomes, cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching.
most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals.
during fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer.
some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.
typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a "stillage" which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between 11–13 °c or 52–55 °f), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost.
the first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as "mashing".
several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.
kyrgyzstan also has a beer made from millet; it is a low alcohol, somewhat porridge-like drink called "bozo".
the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran.
the longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.
the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain.
a relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.
the word beer comes from old english bēor, from proto-germanic *beuzą, probably from proto-indo-european *bʰeusóm, originally "brewer's yeast, beer dregs", although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english bēow, "barley", or latin bibere, "to drink".
since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers.
15, the american anthropological association (aaa) recommended that omb combine the "race" and "ethnicity" categories into one question to appear as "race/ethnicity" for the 2000 us census.
however, the practice of separating "race" and "ethnicity" as different categories has been criticized both by the american anthropological association and members of u.s. commission on civil rights.
in 1935 a federal judge ruled that three mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law.
in 1997, omb issued a federal register notice regarding revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity.
for the first time, free persons were listed individually instead of by head of household.
although used in the census and the american community survey, "some other race" is not an official race, and the bureau considered eliminating it prior to the 2000 census.
residents were still listed individually, but a new questionnaire sheet was used for each family.
the census bureau defines "hispanic or latino" as "a person of cuban, mexican, puerto rican, south or central american or other spanish culture or origin regardless of race."
unlike the spanish milled dollar the u.s. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values.
it was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist.
though still predominantly green, post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations.
these coins are both designated in section 5112 as "legal tender" in payment of debts.
this disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the war of 1812.
the federal reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the u.s. dollar and price stability, reversing the inflation caused by the first world war and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30% deflation in u.s. prices in the 1930s.
a "grand", sometimes shortened to simply "g", is a common term for the amount of $1,000.
the dollar was first based on the value and look of the spanish dollar, used widely in spanish america from the 16th to the 19th centuries.
for example, in the case of the united states the federal reserve targets the federal funds rate, the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight.
under the bretton woods system established after world war ii, the value of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce, and the value of the u.s. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold.
the u.s. dollar is fiat money.
gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century.

this resulted in a great number of soldiers from hanover eventually emigrating to great britain, where the king's german legion was formed.
every year hanover hosts the schützenfest hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the oktoberfest hannover, the second largest oktoberfest in the world (beside oktoberfest of blumenau).
the mahn- und gedenkstätte ahlem describes the history of the jewish people in hanover and the stiftung ahlers pro arte / kestner pro arte shows modern art.
darwin argued that emotions actually served a purpose for humans, in communication and also in aiding their survival.
the issue with the james–lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being a priori), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).
a sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher jesse prinz's book gut reactions, and psychologist james laird's book feelings.
based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness.
a distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions.
emilé durkheim (1915/1965) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in australian aborigine society.
the term emotion was introduced into academic discussion to replace passion.
solomon claims that emotions are judgments.
in the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified.
psychotherapist michael c. graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity.
emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms.
emotions have also been described as biologically given and a result of evolution because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors.
in his 1884 article william james argued that feelings and emotions were secondary to physiological phenomena.
stanley schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a spanish physician, gregorio marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt.
drawing predominantly on goffman and cooley's work, scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond.
emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones (see fear).
emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns.
from the component processing perspective, emotion experience is said to require that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes.
the emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as valence (how negative or positive the experience feels) and arousal (how energized or enervated the experience feels).
the mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept—one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles.
this still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (direction model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (movement model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (action tendency model).
support for the action tendency model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness and research on behavioral inhibition.
recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.
it was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on everton brow in netherfield road.
on matchdays, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the theme tune to z-cars, named "johnny todd", a traditional liverpool children's song collected in 1890 by frank kidson which tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea, although on two separate occasions in the 1994, they ran out to different songs.

both were met with complete disapproval by everton fans.
they are one of seven teams to have played all 22 seasons of the premier league since its inception in august 1992 – the others being arsenal, aston villa, chelsea, liverpool, manchester united, and tottenham hotspur.
formed in 1878, everton were founding members of the football league in 1888 and won their first league championship two seasons later.
the original plan was for a new 60,000-seat stadium to be built, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000 seat stadium as part of the king's dock regeneration.
this was unsuccessful as everton failed to generate the £30 million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, with the city council rejecting the proposal in 2003.
everton agreed a long-term loan of £30 million with bear stearns and prudential plc in 2002 over the duration of 25 years; a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions.
the late centre half and former captain brian labone comes second, having played 534 times.
the longest serving player is goalkeeper ted sagar who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953, both sides of the second world war, making a total of 495 appearances.
everton also have links with chilean team everton de viña del mar who were named after the english club.
a fifteenth-place finish the following season saw royle resign towards the end of the campaign, to be temporarily replaced by club captain, dave watson.
since going blue in 1901, everton have been given the simple nickname "the blues".
old english nouns had grammatical gender, a feature absent in modern english, which uses only natural gender.
for example, the words sunne ("sun"), mōna ("moon") and wīf ("woman/wife") were respectively feminine, masculine and neuter; this is reflected, among other things, in the form of the definite article used with these nouns: sēo sunne ("the sun"), se mōna ("the moon"), þæt wīf ("the woman/wife").
the first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic beowulf, a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of old english.
this form of the language is known as the "winchester standard", or more commonly as late west saxon.
the eagerness of vikings in the danelaw to communicate with their southern anglo-saxon neighbors produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings.
old english developed from a set of anglo-frisian or north sea germanic dialects originally spoken by germanic tribes traditionally known as the angles, saxons, and jutes.
old english developed from a set of anglo-frisian or north sea germanic dialects originally spoken by germanic tribes traditionally known as the angles, saxons, and jutes.
from that time on, the west saxon dialect (then in the form now known as early west saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from latin in that period.
many place-names in eastern and northern england are of scandinavian origin.
the modern forms of latin letters are used, including ⟨g⟩ in place of the insular g, ⟨s⟩ for long s, and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably ⟨e⟩, ⟨f⟩ and ⟨r⟩. macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (
several months later, on 3 november 2011 the russian newspaper izvestiya reported that the naval building plan now included (first) the construction of a new shipyard capable of building large hull ships, after which moscow will build two (80,000 tons full load each) nuclear-powered aircraft carriers by 2027.
as "runways at sea", aircraft carriers have a flat-top flight deck, which launches and recovers aircraft.
an aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.
the 1903 advent of heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of an airplane, made from the deck of a united states navy vessel (cruiser uss birmingham), and the first experimental landings were conducted in 1911.
this change took place during world war ii in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare, driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft.
below this is the flag bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.
the disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or jato rocket.
as of 3 march 2016, there are thirty-seven active aircraft carriers in the world within twelve navies.
the development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships.
as a result of the washington naval treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships.
the 820-foot-long (250 m), 19,500-ton flattop izumo was deployed in march 2015.
while the island is usually built on the starboard side of the fight deck, the japanese aircraft carriers akagi and hiryū had their islands built on the port side.
with the deactivation of uss enterprise in december 2012, the u.s. fleet comprises 10 supercarriers.
although stovl aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck, using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight.
russian, chinese, and future indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.
during the period from 2005–2010, são paulo underwent extensive modernization.
the royal navy is constructing two new larger stovl aircraft carriers, the queen elizabeth class, to replace the three now retired invincible-class carriers.
in 1946, meanwhile, congress gave caa the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at promoting development of the nation's civil airports.
the newly created aeronautics branch, operating under the department of commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.
on october 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism  from nick bilton of the new york times, the faa announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls will still be prohibited.
mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to federal communications commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones.
the conductor david atherton, co-founder of the london sinfonietta, was born in blackpool in 1944.

the first act to break through in the uk who were not from liverpool, or managed by brian epstein, were freddie and the dreamers, who were based in manchester, as were herman's hermits and the hollies.
during roman times the area was part of the brigantes tribal area in the military zone of roman britain.
in the centuries after the roman withdrawal in 410ad the northern parts of the county probably formed part of the brythonic kingdom of rheged, a successor entity to the brigantes tribe.
the red rose of lancaster is the county flower found on the county's heraldic badge and flag.
more recent lancashire-born composers include hugh wood (1932- parbold), sir peter maxwell davies (1934-, salford), sir harrison birtwistle (1934-, accrington), gordon crosse (1937-, bury),john mccabe (1939-2015, huyton), roger smalley (1943-2015, swinton), nigel osborne (1948-, manchester), steve martland (1954-2013, liverpool), simon holt (1958-, bolton) and philip cashian (1963-, manchester).
by the end of the cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that biomass was still dominated by cycad and ferns until after the cretaceous–paleogene extinction.
the upper (cretaceous) boundary is set at the cretaceous–tertiary (kt) extinction event (now more accurately called the cretaceous–paleogene (or k–pg) extinction event), which may have been caused by the impactor that created chicxulub crater on the yucatán peninsula.
eventually, tropics were restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured extreme seasonal changes in weather.
the climate of the cretaceous is less certain and more widely disputed.
on land, dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land, with species such as dilophosaurus at the top.
the dominant land plant species of the time were gymnosperms, which are vascular, cone-bearing, non-flowering plants such as conifers that produce seeds without a coating.
as well, the extant genus sequoia is believed to have evolved in the mesozoic.
it was only in the 1980s that digital telephony transmission networks became possible, such as with isdn networks, assuring a minimum bit rate (usually 128 kilobits/s) for compressed video and audio transmission.
while the mc controls resources and signaling negotiations, the mp operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint.
the availability of freeware (often as part of chat programs) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many.
in general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point-to-point calls between two units.
videophone calls (also: videocalls, video chat as well as skype and skyping in verb form), differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups.
technological developments by videoconferencing developers in the 2010s have extended the capabilities of video conferencing systems beyond the boardroom for use with hand-held mobile devices that combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities broadcasting in real-time over secure networks, independent of location.
students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another, although language barriers will continue to persist.
attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video, such as the first systems developed by at&t corporation, first researched in the 1950s, failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques.
with the exception of sweden, vrs has been provided in europe for only a few years since the mid-2000s, and as of 2010 has not been made available in many european union countries, with most european countries still lacking the legislation or the financing for large-scale vrs services, and to provide the necessary telecommunication equipment to deaf users.
in may 2005, the first high definition video conferencing systems, produced by lifesize communications, were displayed at the interop trade show in las vegas, nevada, able to provide video at 30 frames per second with a 1280 by 720 display resolution.

philip ii of spain decreed the change from the julian to the gregorian calendar, which affected much of roman catholic europe, as philip was at the time ruler over spain and portugal as well as much of italy.
during the period between 1582, when the first countries adopted the gregorian calendar, and 1923, when the last european country adopted it, it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the julian calendar and in the gregorian calendar, for example, "10/21 february 1750/51", where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on 1 january while others were still using some other date.
even before 1582, the year sometimes had to be double dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries.
the motivation for the reform was to bring the date for the celebration of easter to the time of the year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early church.
in the julian calendar a leap year occurs every 4 years, but the gregorian calendar omits 3 leap days every 400 years.
by the 10th century all churches (except some on the eastern border of the byzantine empire) had adopted the alexandrian easter, which still placed the vernal equinox on 21 march, although bede had already noted its drift in 725—it had drifted even further by the 16th century.
for example, scotland changed the start of the scottish new year to 1 january in 1600 (this means that 1599 was a short year).
prior to 1917, turkey used the lunar islamic calendar with the hegira era for general purposes and the julian calendar for fiscal purposes.
a month after having decreed the reform, the pope with a brief of 3 april 1582 granted to antonio lilio, the brother of luigi lilio, the exclusive right to publish the calendar for a period of ten years.
the year used in dates during the roman republic and the roman empire was the consular year, which began on the day when consuls first entered office—probably 1 may before 222 bc, 15 march from 222 bc and 1 january from 153 bc.
the year used in dates during the roman republic and the roman empire was the consular year, which began on the day when consuls first entered office—probably 1 may before 222 bc, 15 march from 222 bc and 1 january from 153 bc.
for example, in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by gregory xiii for the calendar's adoption, friday, 15 october 1582, the preceding date was thursday, 4 october 1582 (julian calendar).
tycho brahe also noticed discrepancies.
the elite package was launched later at us$479.
a live free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already, (such as viva piñata) or games that feature their own subscription service (e.g. ea sports games) can be played with a free account.
xbox live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the xbox live vision.
available in free and subscription-based varieties, xbox live allows users to: play games online; download games (through xbox live arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the xbox music and xbox video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications.
as well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the halo franchise and gears of war, the xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be ps3 exclusives, including devil may cry, ace combat, virtua fighter, grand theft auto iv, final fantasy xiii, tekken 6, metal gear solid : rising, and l.a. noire.
although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the xbox 360 was deemed by techradar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through xbox live, and by popularizing game achievement awards.
the inexpensive nintendo wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding wii u had a poor debut in 2012.
in 2008, gates and president of entertainment & devices robbie bach announced a partnership with bt in the united kingdom, in which the bt vision advanced tv service, using the newer microsoft mediaroom iptv platform, would be accessible via xbox 360, planned for the middle of the year.
these features are available to both free and gold members on xbox live.
microsoft points can be obtained through prepaid cards in 1,600 and 4,000-point denominations.
launched worldwide across 2005–2006, the xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including north america and europe.
edge magazine reported in august 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in japan, where microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals sony and nintendo, had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the xbox 360 completely.
this is possible with video files up to hd-resolution and with several codecs (mpeg-2, mpeg-4, wmv) and container formats (wmv, mov, ts).
microsoft has allowed previous xbox live subscribers to maintain their profile information, friends list, and games history when they make the transition to xbox live gold.
to transfer an xbox live account to the new system, users need to link a windows live id to their gamertag on xbox.com.
this final war was to give thousands of colonists, including virginia colonel george washington, military experience which they put to use during the american revolutionary war.
in 1917 the germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to american entry.
the draft became extremely unpopular, and president nixon ended it in 1973, forcing the military (the army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers.
despite the low death toll, over 180,000 us veterans would later be classified as "permanently disabled" according to the us department of veterans affairs (see gulf war syndrome).
with the coming in 1777 of general von steuben, the training and discipline along prussian lines began, and the continental army began to evolve into a modern force.
when revolutionary france declared war on great britain in 1793, the united states sought to remain neutral, but the jay treaty, which was favorable to great britain, angered the french government, which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 treaty of alliance.
the army performed well in combat in cuba.
it relied on volunteers and state militia units, which faced logistical, training and food problems in the staging areas in florida.
the insurgency collapsed in march 1901 when the leader emilio aguinaldo was captured by general frederick funston and his macabebe allies.
the loss of eight battleships and 2,403 americans at pearl harbor forced the u.s. to rely on its remaining aircraft carriers, which won a major victory over japan at midway just six months into the war, and on its growing submarine fleet.
the u.s. used atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki to destroy the japanese war effort and to shock the japanese leadership, which quickly caused the surrender of japan.
the allies fought against the north vietnamese army (nva) as well as the national liberation front (nlf, also known as viet communists viet cong), or "vc", a guerrilla force within south vietnam.

over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from iraqi president saddam hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 february, many iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.
after just 100 hours of ground combat, and with all of kuwait and much of southern iraq under coalition control, us president george h. w. bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities.
the old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel battleships, bringing them in line with the navies of britain and germany.

congress refused membership in the league of nations, and in response to the growing turmoil in europe and asia, the gradually more restrictive neutrality acts were passed, which were intended to prevent the u.s. from supporting either side in a war.
the kidnapping and decapitation of numerous western journalists and aid-workers also garnered interest and outrage among western powers.
from outside the united kingdom and the united states, the canadian trio rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 (rush, fly by night and caress of steel) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112.
the arrival of scorpions from germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre.
some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: get a grip (1993), which produced four top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and nine lives (1997).
additionally, the black crowes released their debut album, shake your money maker (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies.
early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of chicago blues musicians elmore james, muddy waters, and howlin' wolf, the kingsmen's version of "louie louie" (1963) which made it a garage rock standard, and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced british invasion acts, including "you really got me" by the kinks (1964), "my generation" by the who (1965), "shapes of things" (1966) by the yardbirds and "(i can't get no) satisfaction" (1965) by the rolling stones.
although foo fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts, with albums like in your honor (2005) reaching number two in the us and uk, many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity.
acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included andrew w.k., beautiful creatures and buckcherry, whose breakthrough album 15 (2006) went platinum and spawned the single "sorry" (2007), which made the top 10 of the billboard 100.
drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis.
cream, in songs like "i feel free" (1966) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of eric clapton.
dave davies of the kinks, keith richards of the rolling stones, pete townshend of the who, hendrix, clapton and beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion.
the beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the white album in 1968 and, with the track "helter skelter", attempted to create a greater level of noise than the who.
by the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like led zeppelin, who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums led zeppelin (1969) and led zeppelin ii (1969), and deep purple, who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, in rock (1970).
guns n' roses released the best-selling début of all time, appetite for destruction (1987).
several hundred thousand square miles (several hundred thousand square kilometers) of the great plains have fewer than 6 inhabitants per square mile (2.3 inhabitants per square kilometer)—the density standard frederick jackson turner used to declare the american frontier "closed" in 1893.
the southern portion of the great plains lies over the ogallala aquifer, a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata dating from the last ice age.
during the cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands.
infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space, such as molecular clouds; detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe.
the concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects.
the vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light.
in infrared photography, infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum.
he was surprised at the result and called them "calorific rays".
high, cold ice clouds such as cirrus or cumulonimbus show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly.
thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900–14,000 nanometers or 0.9–14 μm) and produce images of that radiation.
cold, dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars.
infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light.
the beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data.
the infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust.
the 1992 united nations earth summit defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".
the latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation.
interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat.
if a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity.
introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive.
estimates on the number of earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.
the fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history.
this is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity.
this issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.)
brazil's atlantic forest is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly 20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates, and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else.[citation needed] the island of madagascar and india are also particularly notable.
the visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes.
in other cases, such as mongooses in hawaii, the introduction is deliberate but ineffective (nocturnal rats were not vulnerable to the diurnal mongoose).
in other cases, such as oil palms in indonesia and malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly unintended consequences.
for example, microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., extremophile). "

the richness of biodiversity depends on the climatic conditions and area of the region.
biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics.
when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-s (xoff, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving control-q (xon, "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume.
like other character encodings, ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols (i.e. graphemes and control characters).
for example, character 10 represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "backspace".
operating systems from digital equipment corporation, for example, interpreted del as an input character as meaning "remove previously-typed input character", and this interpretation also became common in unix systems.
most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean "remove the character at the cursor".[citation needed] that latter interpretation is the most common now.[citation needed]
however, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-1963 and iso's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ascii's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.
for this reason, eof, or end-of-file, was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-z instead of substitute.
ascii developed from telegraphic codes.
the committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission.
paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape.
the entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.
the original macintosh os, apple dos, and prodos, on the other hand, used carriage return (cr) alone as a line terminator; however, since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix-based os x operating system, they now use line feed (lf) as well.
in the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva.
other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours - eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage.
external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it.
the mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew.
temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed.
protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.
the sport involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus; ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope—on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic.
this apparatus may be made of hemp or a synthetic material which retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness.
the composition requirements are different for each apparatus; this score is called the d score.
deductions in execution and artistry are taken from 10.0.
single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels.
individual routines in trampolining involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills.

gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a springboard, or a small mat.
from 2009, all senior trios and mixed pairs were required to be on the larger floor (10x10m), all groups also perform on this floor.
each country has its own national governing body (biw) affiliated to fig.
stick gymnastics has been taught and performed for many years with the aim of improving physical strength and health.
a year after winning the championship, on 30 july 1930, gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.
in 2011, the club became european champions again and won five trophies.
they have also won five uefa champions league, a record four uefa cup winners' cup, a shared record five uefa super cup and a record three fifa club world cup trophies.
under cruyff's guidance, barcelona won four consecutive la liga titles from 1991 to 1994.
he also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.
in addition to membership, as of 2010[update] there are 1,335 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.

blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of barça's primary board.
the founding message of the club was clearly anti-barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw fc barcelona as a team of foreigners.
the club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the crown of aragon and the bat of king james, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.
at the start of the 1984–85 season, terry venables was hired as manager and he won la liga with noteworthy displays by german midfielder bernd schuster.
founded in 1899 by a group of swiss, english and catalan footballers led by joan gamper, the club has become a symbol of catalan culture and catalanism, hence the motto "més que un club" (more than a club).
the official barcelona anthem is the "cant del barça", written by jaume picas and josep maria espinàs.
one of his main achievements was ensuring barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.
the group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches.
the skinheads slowly transferred the boixos nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for núñez's presidency.
later the same month, barcelona won the uefa super cup after defeating porto 2–0 thanks to goals from lionel messi and cesc fàbregas.
this extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing real madrid's total amount of official trophies.
by scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking real madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.
barcelona won the treble in the 2014–2015 season, winning la liga, copa del rey and uefa champions league titles, and became the first european team to have won the treble twice.
also in the 1960s and 1970s, while fc barcelona acted as an integrating force for catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of spain expecting to find a better life, espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.
the building of camp nou commenced on 28 march 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 barça fans.
from the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, barcelona won the competition four consecutive times.
in 1978, josep lluís núñez became the first elected president of fc barcelona, and, since then, the members of barcelona have elected the club president.
the club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in september 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of ronaldinho and then-president joan laporta's media strategy that focused on spanish and english online media.
according to deloitte, barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to real madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.
after the 1967 case katz v. united states overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, congress passed the omnibus crime control act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand.
from the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s, the fbi reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter-intelligence duties to violent crime, and made violent crime the sixth national priority.
the fbi director is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the fbi.
during the 1950s and 1960s, fbi officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them.
beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the united states and its allies.
in 2003 a congressional committee called the fbi's organized crime informant program "one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement."
between 1993 and 1996, the fbi increased its counter-terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 world trade center bombing in new york city, new york; the 1995 oklahoma city bombing in oklahoma city, oklahoma; and the arrest of the unabomber in 1996.
the primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the fbi, cia and the rest of the united states intelligence community.
one of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so-called sneak and peek provision, granting the fbi powers to search a house while the residents are away, and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterwards.
under the patriot act's provisions, the fbi also resumed inquiring into the library records of those who are suspected of terrorism (something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s).
the revelation caused great embarrassment to the fbi.
robert shivers, head of the honolulu office, obtained permission from hoover to start detaining those on the list on december 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over pearl harbor.
the national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.
after congress passed the communications assistance for law enforcement act (calea, 1994), the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa, 1996), and the economic espionage act (eea, 1996), the fbi followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, just as it did with its cart team in 1991.
the fbi often works in conjunction with other federal agencies, including the u.s. coast guard (uscg) and u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) in seaport and airport security, and the national transportation safety board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents.

the fbi academy, located in quantico, virginia, is home to the communications and computer laboratory the fbi utilizes.
hoover responded by publicly calling king the most "notorious liar" in the united states.
the system is used by law enforcement agencies in the united states for collecting and reporting data on crimes.
the fbi is headquartered at the j. edgar hoover building in washington, d.c., with 56 field offices in major cities across the united states.
many specialized fbi functions are located at facilities in quantico, virginia, as well as a "data campus" in clarksburg, west virginia, where 96 million sets of fingerprints "from across the united states are stored, along with others collected by american authorities from prisoners in saudi arabia and yemen, iraq and afghanistan."
after prolonged negative coverage in the press, the fbi changed the name of its system from "carnivore" to "dcs1000."
the fbi has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s.
the gospel of luke begins its account of mary's life with the annunciation, when the angel gabriel appeared to her and announced her divine selection to be the mother of jesus.
the gospel of luke begins its account of mary's life with the annunciation, when the angel gabriel appeared to her and announced her divine selection to be the mother of jesus.
after the prophecies of simeon and the prophetess anna in luke 2:25-38 concluded, joseph and mary took jesus and "returned into galilee, to their own city nazareth".[luke 2:39]
in the 19th century, a house near ephesus in turkey was found, based on the visions of anne catherine emmerich, an augustinian nun in germany.
the gospel of john states that mary went to live with the disciple whom jesus loved,[jn 19:27] identified as john the evangelist.[citation needed] irenaeus and eusebius of caesarea wrote in their histories that john later went to ephesus, which may provide the basis for the early belief that mary also lived in ephesus with john.
the icon of the virgin theotokos with christ is without doubt the most venerated icon in the orthodox church.
according to william e. phipps, in the book survivals of roman religion "gordon laing argues convincingly that the worship of artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of mary."
despite martin luther's harsh polemics against his roman catholic opponents over issues concerning mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that luther adhered to the marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church.
the account given in sura 19 is nearly identical with that in the gospel according to luke, and both of these (luke, sura 19) begin with an account of the visitation of an angel upon zakariya (zecharias) and good news of the birth of yahya (john), followed by the account of the annunciation.
thus unlike the protestant churches at large, the anglican communion (which includes the episcopal church in the united states) includes segments which still retain some veneration of mary.
as such, methodists believe that mary was conceived in her womb through the holy ghost and accept the doctrine of the virgin birth, although they, along with orthodox christians and other protestant christians, reject the doctrine of the immaculate conception.
she is the only woman directly named in the qur'an; declared (uniquely along with jesus) to be a sign of god to humanity; as one who "guarded her chastity"; an obedient one; chosen of her mother and dedicated to allah whilst still in the womb; uniquely (amongst women) accepted into service by god; cared for by (one of the prophets as per islam) zakariya (zacharias); that in her childhood she resided in the temple and uniquely had access to al-mihrab (understood to be the holy of holies), and was provided with heavenly "provisions" by god.
the eastern and oriental orthodox, roman catholic, anglican, and lutheran churches believe that mary, as mother of jesus, is the mother of god and the theotokos, literally "giver of birth to god".
the sunday of orthodoxy directly links the virgin mary's identity as mother of god with icon veneration.
mary is referred to by the eastern orthodox church, oriental orthodoxy, the anglican church, and all eastern catholic churches as theotokos, a title recognized at the third ecumenical council (held at ephesus to address the teachings of nestorius, in 431).
the name panthera may be a distortion of the term parthenos (virgin) and raymond e. brown considers the story of panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of jesus which includes very little historical evidence.

after richard's death on 6 april 1199 there were two potential claimants to the angevin throne: john, whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of henry ii, and young arthur i of brittany, who held a claim as the son of john's elder brother geoffrey.
with arthur's army pressing up the loire valley towards angers and philip's forces moving down the valley towards tours, john's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two.
chroniclers recorded that john had a "mad infatuation" with isabella, and certainly john had conjugal relationships with isabella between at least 1207 and 1215; they had five children.
john infamously offended the local irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the anglo-norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the irish and finally returned to england later in the year, blaming the viceroy, hugh de lacy, for the fiasco.
as part of the deal, john offered to surrender the kingdom of england to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to £666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (£466) for england and 300 marks (£200) for ireland, as well as recompensing the church for revenue lost during the crisis.
the rebel barons responded by inviting the french prince louis to lead them: louis had a claim to the english throne by virtue of his marriage to blanche of castile, a granddaughter of henry ii.
arthur's sister, eleanor, who had also been captured at mirebeau, was kept imprisoned by john for many years, albeit in relatively good conditions.
in the aftermath of john's death william marshal was declared the protector of the nine-year-old henry iii.
one of john's principal challenges was acquiring the large sums of money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim normandy.
numerous barons were subjected to john's malevolentia, even including william marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model of utter loyalty.
as an emergency measure, john recreated a version of henry ii's assize of arms of 1181, with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies.
during richard's rule, john had successfully increased the size of his lands in ireland, and he continued this policy as king.
john besieged the castle of roche-au-moine, a key stronghold, forcing louis to give battle against john's larger army.
a peace agreement was signed in which john returned anjou to philip and paid the french king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years.
henry ii wanted to secure the southern borders of aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to alais, the daughter and heiress of humbert iii of savoy.
john's relief operation was blocked by philip's forces, and john turned back to brittany in an attempt to draw philip away from eastern normandy.
john took a close interest in wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, joan, to the welsh prince llywelyn the great.
the king used the marcher lords and the native welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the welsh rulers.
monastic communities were allowed to celebrate mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the holy viaticum for the dying was authorised.
mandeville immediately died, and longchamp took over as joint justiciar with puiset, which would prove to be a less than satisfactory partnership.
warfare in normandy at the time was shaped by the defensive potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns.
another section of royal followers were the curia regis; these curiales were the senior officials and agents of the king and were essential to his day-to-day rule.
john's lack of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that john was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time.
his eldest son, henry iii, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century.
the performance advantage of 68000-based macintosh systems was eroded by intel's pentium, and in 1994 apple was relegated to third place as compaq became the top pc manufacturer.
smith's first macintosh board was built to raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kb) of ram, used the motorola 6809e microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display.
initially developed in the pascal programming language, it was substantially rewritten in c++ for system 7.
compaq, who had previously held the third place spot among pc manufacturers during the 1980s and early-mid 1990s, initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end, overtaking a struggling ibm and relegating apple to third place.
in response, apple introduced a range of relatively inexpensive macs in october 1990.
starting in 2006, apple's industrial design shifted to favor aluminum, which was used in the construction of the first macbook pro.
he wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the mcintosh, but the spelling was changed to "macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by mcintosh laboratory, inc., the audio equipment manufacturer.
regis mckenna called the ad "more successful than the mac itself." "
apple reported worldwide sales of 3.36 million macs during the 2009 holiday season.
as of mid-2011, the macintosh continues to enjoy rapid market share increase in the us, growing from 7.3% of all computer shipments in 2010 to 9.3% in 2011.
to provide a complete office suite, claris purchased the rights to the informix wingz spreadsheet program on the mac, renaming it claris resolve, and added the new presentation software claris impact.
because the operating system was designed largely around the gui, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten.
this succeeded in increasing the macintosh's market share somewhat, and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt apple financially as existing apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of apple's higher-margin macintosh systems, yet apple still shouldered the burden of developing the mac os platform.
it is free of charge to everyone running snow leopard or later and is compatible with most macs from 2007 and later.
historically, mac os x enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that affect microsoft windows users.
in 1989, jean-louis gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding pc industry that year, forcing apple usa head allan loren to cut prices which dropped apple's margins.
by contrast the msrp of the macbook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the macbook air and macbook pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a mac, with the exception of the even more inexpensive mac mini (the only sub-$1000 offering from apple, albeit without a monitor and keyboard), not surprisingly the macbooks are the top-selling form factors of the macintosh platform today.
in 1993 intel rolled out the pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the macintosh platform a generation behind ibm compatibles in the latest cpu technology.
in 1993 intel rolled out the pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the macintosh platform a generation behind ibm compatibles in the latest cpu technology.
apple discontinued the use of powerpc microprocessors in 2006.
following the release of intel-based macs, third-party platform virtualization software such as parallels desktop, vmware fusion, and virtualbox began to emerge.
this was divided into two arms, pvo strany, the strategic air defence service responsible for air defence of the homeland, created in 1941 and becoming an independent service in 1954, and pvo sv, air defence of the ground forces.
on 30 september 1915, troops of the serbian army observed three enemy aircraft approaching kragujevac.
furthermore, in britain the volunteer observer corps formed in 1925 provided a network of observation posts to report hostile aircraft flying over britain.
a 2-inch rocket using he or wire obstacle warheads was introduced first to deal with low-level or dive bombing attacks on smaller targets such as airfields.
the gun became so important to the british war effort that they even produced a movie, the gun, that encouraged workers on the assembly line to work harder.
the interceptor aircraft (or simply interceptor) is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft, particularly bombers, usually relying on high speed and altitude capabilities.
area defence systems have medium to long range and can be made up of various other systems and networked into an area defence system (in which case it may be made up of several short range systems combined to effectively cover an area).
an example of area defence is the defence of saudi arabia and israel by mim-104 patriot missile batteries during the first gulf war, where the objective was to cover populated areas.
it remains a vital activity by ground forces and includes camouflage and concealment to avoid detection by reconnaissance and attacking aircraft.
two assumptions underpinned the british approach to haa fire; first, aimed fire was the primary method and this was enabled by predicting gun data from visually tracking the target and having its height.
another aspect of anti-aircraft defence was the use of barrage balloons to act as physical obstacle initially to bomber aircraft over cities and later for ground attack aircraft over the normandy invasion fleets.
land-based sams can be deployed from fixed installations or mobile launchers, either wheeled or tracked.
in the later decades of the cold war this included the united states air force's operating bases in uk.
trials were underway in most countries in europe but only krupp, erhardt, vickers maxim, and schneider had published any information by 1910.
in addition the raf regiment was formed in 1941 with responsibility for airfield air defence, eventually with bofors 40mm as their main armament.
at short range, the apparent target area is relatively large, the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short, allowing to correct lead by watching the tracers.
rheinmetall in germany developed an automatic 20 mm in the 1920s and oerlikon in switzerland had acquired the patent to an automatic 20 mm gun designed in germany during world war i. germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm flak 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by mauser-werke and became the 2 cm flak 38.
the germans developed massive reinforced concrete blockhouses, some more than six stories high, which were known as hochbunker "high bunkers" or "flaktürme" flak towers, on which they placed anti-aircraft artillery.
similar predictor systems were introduced by germany during the war, also adding radar ranging as the war progressed.
speed and altitude of modern jet aircraft limit target opportunities, and critical systems may be armored in aircraft designed for the ground attack role.
adaptations of the standard autocannon, originally intended for air-to-ground use, and heavier artillery systems were commonly used for most anti-aircraft gunnery, starting with standard pieces on new mountings, and evolving to specially designed guns with much higher performance prior to world war ii.
facing the threat of japanese kamikaze attacks the british and us developed surface-to-air rockets like british stooge or the american lark as counter measures, but none of them were ready at the end of the war.
smaller weapons, typically .50 caliber or even 8 mm rifle caliber guns have been used in the smallest mounts.
most modern air defence systems are fairly mobile.
these may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms, whether they are self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (spaags), integrated air-defence systems like tunguska or all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms like roland or sa-8 gecko.
air defence evolution covered the areas of sensors and technical fire control, weapons, and command and control.
similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later sperry device, designated m3a3 in the us was also used by britain as the predictor aa no 2.
the system used a centralised control system including both search and targeting radar, which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics, and then sent electrical commands to the guns, which used hydraulics to point themselves at high speeds.
the 90 mm and 120 mm guns would continue to be used into the 1950s.
the allies' most advanced technologies were showcased by the anti-aircraft defence against the german v-1 cruise missiles (v stands for vergeltungswaffe, "retaliation weapon").
with the liberation of antwerp, the port city immediately became the highest priority target, and received the largest number of v-1 and v-2 missiles of any city.
british naval missiles used included sea dart and the older sea slug longer range systems, sea cat and the new sea wolf short range systems.
the sams launched by individuals are known in the united states as the man-portable air defence systems (manpads).
however, as stealth technology grows, so does anti-stealth technology.
the newest sam's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets, with the most notable being the s-400, which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05 meter squared rcs from 90 km away.
sudharma, a daily newspaper in sanskrit, has been published out of mysore, india, since 1970, while sanskrit vartman patram and vishwasya vrittantam started in gujarat during the last five years.

sanskrit, as the learned language of ancient india, thus existed alongside the vernacular prakrits, which were middle indo-aryan languages.
knowledge of sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient india, and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of vyākaraṇins such as pāṇini and patanjali, who exhorted proper sanskrit at all times, especially during ritual.
a significant form of post-vedic sanskrit is found in the sanskrit of indian epic poetry—the ramayana and mahabharata.

buddhism was spread to china by mahayana missionaries sent by ashoka, mostly through translations of buddhist hybrid sanskrit.
the earliest known inscriptions in sanskrit date to the first century bce.[citation needed] they are in the brahmi script, which was originally used for prakrit, not sanskrit.
in order to explain the common features shared by sanskrit and other indo-european languages, many scholars have proposed the indo-aryan migration theory, asserting that the original speakers of what became sanskrit arrived in what is now india and pakistan from the north-west some time during the early second millennium bce.
in the medieval era, sanskrit continued to be spoken and written, particularly by learned brahmins for scholarly communication.

in 1986, the goldwater–nichols act mandated that operational control of the services follows a chain of command from the president to the secretary of defense directly to the unified combatant commanders, who have control of all armed forces units in their geographic or function area of responsibility.
collective training at the unit level takes place at the unit's assigned station, but the most intensive training at higher echelons is conducted at the three combat training centers (ctc); the national training center (ntc) at fort irwin, california, the joint readiness training center (jrtc) at fort polk, louisiana, and the joint multinational training center (jmrc) at the hohenfels training area in hohenfels, germany.

napoleon's new prime minister, emile ollivier, declared that france had done all that it could humanly and honorably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility "with a light heart."
by the time he realized what kind of a force he was opposing, it was too late.
the french railway system, with multiple competing companies, had developed purely from commercial pressures and many journeys to the front in alsace and lorraine involved long diversions and frequent changes between trains.
rail sidings and marshalling yards became choked with loaded wagons, with nobody responsible for unloading them or directing them to the destination.

one manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning, which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking.
wisdom is not the same as intelligence: adolescents do not improve substantially on iq tests since their scores are relative to others in their same age group, and relative standing usually does not change—everyone matures at approximately the same rate in this way.

while adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience during this period of development takes place within romantic relationships.
these likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.
since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem.
adolescents who have a good relationship with their parents are less likely to engage in various risk behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, fighting, and/or unprotected sexual intercourse.
furthermore, to avoid ethnocentrism, researchers must be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.
some adolescents use these newer channels to enhance relationships with peers however there can be negative uses as well such as cyberbullying, as mentioned previously, and negative impacts on the family.
girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group.
for instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling so that, when they reach adolescence, they can begin working.
drinking habits and the motives behind them often reflect certain aspects of an individual's personality; in fact, four dimensions of the five-factor model of personality demonstrate associations with drinking motives (all but 'openness').

while uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons.
at levels of 10 mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.
uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing orange-red to lemon yellow hues.
the 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth, who named the new element after the planet uranus.
the uranium-based little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945.
uo2+ 2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents, the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate.
the price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in july 2007 from $5 in 2001.
finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.

animals that are forced to eat during their resting period show increased body mass and altered expression of clock and metabolic genes.[medical citation needed] in humans, shift-work that favors irregular eating times is associated with altered insulin sensitivity and higher body mass.
studies conducted on both animals and humans show major bidirectional relationships between the circadian system and abusive drugs.
recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the great oxidation event approximately 2.3 billion years ago.
mutations or deletions of clock gene in mice have demonstrated the importance of body clocks to ensure the proper timing of cellular/metabolic events; clock-mutant mice are hyperphagic and obese, and have altered glucose metabolism.

research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.
sexual identity and sexual behavior are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with sexual identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to "fantasies, attachments and longings."
no major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.
these include the american psychiatric association, american psychological association, american counseling association, national association of social workers in the usa, the royal college of psychiatrists, and the australian psychological society.
it is assumed that these scales will be able to reliably identify and categorize people by their sexual orientation.

knowing how much of the population is made up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies.
another study on men and women's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal, independent of their sexual orientations.
related terms such as pansexual and polysexual do not make any such assignations to the subject.
this understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as karl heinrich ulrichs, richard von krafft-ebing, magnus hirschfeld, havelock ellis, carl jung, and sigmund freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves.
however, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation.
for example, "ô-môi" for vietnamese american queer females.
in the united states, non-caucasian lgbt individuals may find themselves in a double minority, where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly caucasian lgbt communities, nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group.
many people experience racism in the dominant lgbt community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes, such that asian-american lgbts are viewed as more passive and feminine, while african-american lgbts are viewed as more masculine and aggressive.
in 2012, the pan american health organization (the north and south american branch of the world health organization) released a statement cautioning against services that purport to "cure" people with non-heterosexual sexual orientations as they lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people, and noted that the global scientific and professional consensus is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition.
as there is no research indicating which of the three components is essential in defining sexual orientation, all three are used independently and provide different conclusions regarding sexual orientation.
most definitions of sexual orientation include a psychological component, such as the direction of an individual's erotic desires, or a behavioral component, which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s.
some people prefer simply to follow an individual's self-definition or identity.
in freud's view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality.
the national association for research & therapy of homosexuality (narth), which describes itself as a "professional, scientific organization that offers hope to those who struggle with unwanted homosexuality," disagrees with the mainstream mental health community's position on conversion therapy, both on its effectiveness and by describing sexual orientation not as a binary immutable quality, or as a disease, but as a continuum of intensities of sexual attractions and emotional affect.
any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense among the affected subjects.
the kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality.
however, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum.
they report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences.
it has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation.
one of the earliest sexual orientation classification schemes was proposed in the 1860s by karl heinrich ulrichs in a series of pamphlets he published privately.
it would have been quite simple for kinsey to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information.
furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour.
research suggests that sexual orientation is independent of cultural and other social influences, but that open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobic/hetereosexist settings.
social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation.
the scale was developed to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and that these two types represent antitheses in the sexual world.
the scale was developed to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and that these two types represent antitheses in the sexual world.
in response to the criticism of the kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, fritz klein developed the klein sexual orientation grid (ksog), a multidimensional scale for describing sexual orientation.
secondly, savin-williams suggests that researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether and assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated.
some studies only consider a person bisexual if they are nearly equally attracted to both sexes, and others consider a person bisexual if they are at all attracted to the same sex (for otherwise mostly heterosexual persons) or to the opposite sex (for otherwise mostly homosexual persons).
originally, dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company’s internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.
dell had long stuck by its direct sales model.
in the shrinking pc industry, dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world.
dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including "burn-in"), and quality control.
by the late 2000s, dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual pcs configured to customer specifications from its us facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume asian contract manufacturers as pcs became powerful low-cost commodities.
some of dell inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors.
to maintain its low prices, dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to india and el salvador.
it was alleged that dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer amd.
consequently, dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998.

the company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of it equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment dell sold seven years earlier.
in the 1990s, dell switched from using primarily atx motherboards and psu to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors.
while motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as mmc readers and power on/off switches and leds).

the company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation.
the release of apple's ipad tablet computer had a negative impact on dell and other major pc vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop pcs.
dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running windows or google android.
dell has responded by pushing higher-end pcs, such as the xps line of notebooks, which do not compete with the apple ipad and kindle fire tablets.
less than a year later, dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building.
the value of vmware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported.
dell service and support brands include the dell solution station (extended domestic support services, previously "dell on call"), dell support center (extended support services abroad), dell business support (a commercial service-contract that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues), dell everdream desktop management ("software as a service" remote-desktop management, originally a saas company founded by elon musk's cousin, lyndon rive, which dell bought in 2007), and your tech team (a support-queue available to home users who purchased their systems either through dell's website or through dell phone-centers).
in late 2006[update], dell lost its lead in the pc-business to hewlett-packard.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996, a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court.
the first use of the gas chamber after the moratorium was the gassing of jesse bishop in nevada on october 22, 1979.
oregon abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964 public referendum but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death penalty/life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin after a similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to judicial rulings.
this is due to judges overriding life imprisonment sentences and imposing the death penalty.
puerto rico's constitution expressly forbids capital punishment, stating "the death penalty shall not exist", setting it apart from all u.s. states and territories other than michigan, which also has a constitutional prohibition (eleven other states and the district of columbia have abolished capital punishment through statutory law).
however, capital punishment is still applicable to offenses committed in puerto rico, if they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government, though federal death penalty prosecutions there have generated significant controversy.
connecticut general statute § 54–100 requires death sentences to be conducted in an "enclosure" which "shall be so constructed as to exclude public view."
in 1976, contemporaneously with woodson and roberts, the court decided gregg v. georgia and upheld a procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases.
since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976, 1,411 people have been executed, almost exclusively by the states, with most occurring after 1990.
prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.
the united states supreme court in penry v. lynaugh and the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in bigby v. dretke have been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the defendant's mental health violate the defendant's eighth amendment rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions.
however, the united states government executed tony chebatoris at the federal correctional institution in milan, michigan in 1938.)
in 2004, a constitutional amendment proposed to allow capital punishment in some circumstances failed to make it on the november ballot after a resolution failed in the legislature and a public initiative failed to gather enough signatures.
nebraska's death penalty statute was rendered ineffective on february 8, 2008 when the required method, electrocution, was ruled unconstitutional by the nebraska supreme court.
on the question of the death penalty vs. life without parole, the strongest preference for the death penalty was 61 percent in 1997 (29 percent favoring life), and the lowest preference for the death penalty was 47 percent in 2006 (48 percent favoring life).
various methods have been used in the history of the american colonies and the united states but only five methods are currently used.
however, that number is lower than that of prison inmates, which is 47 percent.
typically, it involves four critical steps: (1) sentencing, (2) direct review, (3) state collateral review, and (4) federal habeas corpus.
since 1642 (in the 13 colonies, the united states under the articles of confederation, and the current united states) an estimated 364 juvenile offenders have been put to death by the states and the federal government.
in may 2014, oklahoma director of corrections, robert patton, recommended an indefinite hold on executions in the state after the botched execution of african-american clayton lockett.
the prisoner had to be tasered to restrain him prior to the execution, and the lethal injection missed a vein in his groin, resulting in lockett regaining consciousness, trying to get up, and to speak, before dying of a heart attack 43 minutes later, after the attempted execution had been called off.
furthermore, some opponents argue that the arbitrariness with which it is administered and the systemic influence of racial, socio-economic, geographic, and gender bias on determinations of desert make the current practice of capital punishment immoral and illegitimate.
opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of deterring crime, risks the execution of the innocent, is unnecessarily barbaric in nature, cheapens human life, and puts a government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in murder.
sixteen was held to be the minimum permissible age in the 1988 supreme court decision of thompson v. oklahoma.
much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés david hume and adam smith.
some poetry became infused with scientific metaphor and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics.
hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of european liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.
the british government for the most part ignored the enlightenment's leaders in england and scotland, although it did give isaac newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office.
government responses varied widely.
topics of public controversy were also discussed such as the theories of newton and descartes, the slave trade, women's education, and justice in france.
they included frederick the great of prussia, catherine the great of russia, leopold ii of tuscany, and joseph ii of austria.
for example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine, while geometry and logic were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively.
indeed, the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in women's education.
freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in scotland around 1600 and spread first to england and then across the continent in the eighteenth century.
they fostered new codes of conduct – including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – "liberty, fraternity, and equality" scottish soldiers and jacobite scots brought to the continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the english revolution against royal absolutism.
locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the united states declaration of independence and the french national constituent assembly's declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen.
attempts to reconcile science and religion resulted in a widespread rejection of prophecy, miracle and revealed religion in preference for deism – especially by thomas paine in the age of reason and by thomas jefferson in his short jefferson bible – from which all supernatural aspects were removed.
this was especially true on the continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of british values was often seen as threatening by state authorities.
coffeehouses were essential to the enlightenment, for they were centers of free-thinking and self-discovery.
the major opponent of freemasonry was the roman catholic church, so that in countries with a large catholic element, such as france, italy, spain, and mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between what davies calls the reactionary church and enlightened freemasonry.
there were two distinct lines of enlightenment thought: the radical enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of spinoza, advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression, and eradication of religious authority; and a second, more moderate variety, supported by rené descartes, john locke, christian wolff, isaac newton and others, which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith.
many others like voltaire held that without belief in a god who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined.
additionally, most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes.
the increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the "social" enlightenment.
many of the leading universities associated with enlightenment progressive principles were located in northern europe, with the most renowned being the universities of leiden, göttingen, halle, montpellier, uppsala and edinburgh.
in france, the major exception was the medical university at montpellier.
some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.
the experiments of lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in paris, and the experiments of the montgolfier brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 november 1783, from the château de la muette, near the bois de boulogne.
alexis de tocqueville described the french revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the enlightenment.
they shifted the attention of the "cultivated public" away from established authorities to novelty and innovation, and promoted the "enlightened" ideals of toleration and intellectual objectivity.
although the existence of dictionaries and encyclopedias spanned into ancient times, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century encyclopedic dictionaries.
it was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in 1662.
the presence of noble women in the french "lodges of adoption" that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society.
along with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.
sir isaac newton's celebrated philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica was published in latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.
the disks were used both for storing the game and saving progress and total capacity was 128k (64k per side).
after test-marketing in the new york city area in late fall, retailers had reportedly stated the system "failed miserably".[contradictory] while others stated that nintendo had an excellent nine-week market test in new york last fall due to the moderate success launch in new york city, nintendo tried a second time; the system was test-marketed further beginning in february 1986, with the nationwide release occurring in september 1986.
the console remained popular in japan and north america until late 1993, when the demand for new nes software abruptly plummeted.
unlike atari, which never actively courted third-party developers (and even went to court in an attempt to force activision to cease production of atari 2600 games), nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers; strictly, however, on nintendo's terms.
several companies, refusing to pay the licensing fee or having been rejected by nintendo, found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system.
problems with the 10nes lockout chip frequently resulted in the console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10nes would reset the console once per second.
problems with the 10nes lockout chip frequently resulted in the console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10nes would reset the console once per second.
many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system.[citation needed] in 1989, nintendo released an official nes cleaning kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.
by 1988, industry observers stated that the nes's popularity had grown so quickly that the market for nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software.
in addition, the drive use a belt which breaks frequently and requires invasive replacement.
the united states department of justice and several states began probing nintendo's business practices, leading to the involvement of congress and the federal trade commission (ftc).
following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the famicom.
on the nes, these special controllers were generally connected to one of the two control ports on the front of the console.
these unauthorized clones have been helped by the invention of the so-called nes-on-a-chip.
before the nes/famicom, nintendo was known as a moderately successful japanese toy and playing card manufacturer, and the popularity of the nes/famicom helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as atari had been during the 2600 era and set the stage for japanese dominance of the video game industry.
atari games created a line of nes products under the name tengen and took a different approach.
in response to these hardware flaws, "nintendo authorized repair centers" sprang up across the u.s. according to nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired.
he was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him.
athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of upper egypt, where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings; "apology to constantius", the "apology for his flight", the "letter to the monks", and the "history of the arians".
athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 february, 362.
he issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by constantius, but who had been permitted by jovian to return to their sees.
roman emperor constantine the great had convened the council in may–august 325 to address the arian position that the son of god, jesus of nazareth, is of a distinct substance from the father.
after questioning athanasius, bishop alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the form and matter of the sacrament had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly catechized.
constantius's persistence in his opposition to athanasius, combined with reports athanasius received about the persecution of non-arians by the new arian bishop george of laodicea, prompted athanasius to write his more emotional history of the arians, in which he described constantius as a precursor of the antichrist.
a "homoeon" creed was adopted, declaring the son to be "like the father".
on 23 october the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.
athanasius also wrote a two-part against the heathen and the incarnation of the word of god.
athanasius called many of his opponents "arian", except for miletus.
athanasius is venerated as a christian saint, whose feast day is 2 may in western christianity, 15 may in the coptic orthodox church, and 18 january in the other eastern orthodox churches.
alexandria was the most important trade center in the whole empire during athanasius's boyhood.
athanasius's first problem lay with meletius of lycopolis and his followers, who had failed to abide by the first council of nicaea.
athanasius knew greek and admitted not knowing hebrew [see, e.g., the 39th festal letter of st. athan.].
nonetheless, during his later exile, with no access to a copy of the scriptures, athanasius could quote from memory every verse in the old testament with a supposed reference to the trinity without missing any.[citation needed] the combination of scriptural study and of greek learning was characteristic of the famous alexandrian school.
however, upon constans's death in 350, another civil war broke out, which left pro-arian constantius as sole emperor.
the bishops had nothing better.
he was ordered into banishment to beroea, in thrace; beroea (thrace).
they supported the tenets of origenist thought and theology, but had little else in common.

thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year.
the region is largely shielded from pacific storms by the olympic mountains and from arctic air by the cascade range.
both streams of air originate over the pacific ocean; airflow is split by the olympic mountains to seattle's west, then reunited to the east.
lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.
in 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040.
however, former mayor greg nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping seattle's single-family housing zoning laws.
the seattle city council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city centre.
still, very large companies dominate the business landscape.

the hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also.
one question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain.
scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (byrne 2007).
cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation.
it is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences.
however, the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and vague.[citation needed] working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought.
autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory.
an experimental study by german cognitive psychologists l. schwabe and o. wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans.
for example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning, while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory.
therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on.
korsakoff's syndrome, also known as korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.
the researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.
slaves were counted separately from free persons in all the censuses until the civil war and end of slavery.
by 1990, the census bureau included more than a dozen ethnic/racial categories on the census, reflecting not only changing social ideas about ethnicity, but the wide variety of immigrants who had come to reside in the united states due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s.
according to the census bureau, as of 2002, over 75% of all african americans had multiracial ancestries.
americans with sub-saharan african ancestry for historical reasons: slavery, partus sequitur ventrem, one-eighth law, the one-drop rule of 20th-century legislation, have frequently been classified as black (historically) or african american, even if they have significant european american or native american ancestry.
these were prohibited from official relationships with whites.
after the american revolutionary war, the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed.
in their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation, in the early 20th century, most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule, defining as black, persons with any known african ancestry.

statistical figures vary for the contemporary demography of ashkenazi jews, oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million.
his contemporary saadia gaon identified ashkenaz with the saquliba or slavic territories, and such usage covered also the lands of tribes neighboring the slavs, and eastern and central europe.
in gaul and germany itself, with the possible exception of trier and cologne, the archeological evidence suggests at most a fleeting presence of very few jews, primarily itinerant traders or artisans.
throughout this period and into the early middle ages, some jews assimilated into the dominant greek and latin cultures, mostly through conversion to christianity.[better source needed] king dagobert i of the franks expelled the jews from his merovingian kingdom in 629.
using snp microarray techniques and linkage analysis found that when assuming druze and palestinian arab populations to represent the reference to world jewry ancestor genome, between 35 to 55 percent of the modern ashkenazi genome can possibly be of european origin, and that european "admixture is considerably higher than previous estimates by studies that used the y chromosome" with this reference point.

as ashkenazi jews moved away from europe, mostly in the form of aliyah to israel, or immigration to north america, and other english-speaking areas; and europe (particularly france) and latin america, the geographic isolation that gave rise to ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-ashkenazi jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales.
strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, ashkenazi jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an ashkenazi jew's ancestors came from poland, russia, hungary, lithuania, or any other place with a historical jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group.
the authors also report on eu 19 (r1a) chromosomes, which are very frequent in central and eastern europeans (54%–60%) at elevated frequency (12.7%) in ashkenazi jews.
they hypothesized that the differences among ashkenazim jews could reflect low-level gene flow from surrounding european populations and/or genetic drift during isolation.
in the late middle ages the center of gravity of the ashkenazi population, and its traditional cultural life, shifted steadily eastward, out of the german lands into poland and lithuania (including present-day belarus and ukraine).

the article noted that major healthcare organizations such as national center for advancing translational sciences of the national institutes of health, the president’s council of advisors on science and technology, the world economic forum, the gates foundation, the wellcome trust, and the food and drug administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to bring greater benefits to patients.
in the uk, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency approves drugs for use, though the evaluation is done by the european medicines agency, an agency of the european union based in london.
because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents.
ben goldacre has argued that regulators – such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) in the uk, or the food and drug administration (fda) in the united states – advance the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public due to revolving door exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships develop between regulator and company employees.
he argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.
depending on a number of considerations, a company may apply for and be granted a patent for the drug, or the process of producing the drug, granting exclusivity rights typically for about 20 years.

the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu-men (pertaining to pitch), and by others, pixtumens (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to bitumen, thence passing via french into english.
one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835.
because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural-gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil, called synbit.
material with a boiling point greater than around 500 °c is considered asphalt.
the rock asphalt is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction.

for statistical purposes, the country is divided into three metropolitan areas: tel aviv metropolitan area (population 3,206,400), haifa metropolitan area (population 1,021,000), and beer sheva metropolitan area (population 559,700).
the status of east jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between israeli governments and representatives of the palestinians, as israel views it as its sovereign territory, as well as part of its capital.
israel is also at the technological forefront of desalination and water recycling.
it was first launched in 1988, making israel the eighth nation to have a space launch capability.
israel's diverse culture stems from the diversity of its population: jews from diaspora communities around the world have brought their cultural and religious traditions back with them, creating a melting pot of jewish customs and beliefs.
itzhak perlman, pinchas zukerman and ofra haza are among the internationally acclaimed musicians born in israel.[citation needed] israel has participated in the eurovision song contest nearly every year since 1973, winning the competition three times and hosting it twice.
the nation's canonical folk songs, known as "songs of the land of israel," deal with the experiences of the pioneers in building the jewish homeland.
the city of beersheba has become a national chess center, with the game being taught in the city's kindergartens.
the hellenistic period covers the period of ancient greek (hellenic) history and mediterranean history between the death of alexander the great in 323 bc and the emergence of the roman empire as signified by the battle of actium in 31 bc and the subsequent conquest of ptolemaic egypt the following year.
after alexander the great's ventures in the persian empire, hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west asia (seleucid empire, kingdom of pergamon), north-east africa (ptolemaic kingdom) and south asia (greco-bactrian kingdom, indo-greek kingdom).
soon, however, perdiccas had meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered, and assumed full control.
seleucus arrived in time to save lysimachus and utterly crushed antigonus at the battle of ipsus in 301 bce.
seleucus arrived in time to save lysimachus and utterly crushed antigonus at the battle of ipsus in 301 bce.
meanwhile, lysimachus took over ionia, seleucus took cilicia, and ptolemy captured cyprus.
after demetrius poliorcetes captured athens in 307 and restored the democracy, the athenians honored him and his father antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the agora and granting them the title of king.
sparta remained independent, but it was no longer the leading military power in the peloponnese.
agathocles extended his power throughout most of the greek cities in sicily, fought a long war with the carthaginians, at one point invading tunisia in 310 and defeating a carthaginian army there.
hellenistic monarchs ran their kingdoms as royal estates and most of the heavy tax revenues went into the military and paramilitary forces which preserved their rule from any kind of revolution.
the hellenistic states of asia and egypt were run by an occupying imperial elite of greco-macedonian administrators and governors propped up by a standing army of mercenaries and a small core of greco-macedonian settlers.
after the death of ptolemy iv (204), antiochus took advantage of the weakness of egypt to conquer coele-syria in the fifth syrian war (202-195).
in the early 2nd century bc, the galatians became allies of antiochus the great, the last seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over asia minor.
it was founded by mithridates i in 291 bc and lasted until its conquest by the roman republic in 63 bc.
alexander appointed an orontid named mithranes to govern armenia.
towards the end 212 bc the country was divided into two kingdoms, greater armenia and armenia sophene including commagene or armenia minor.
the seleucid–parthian wars continued as the seleucids invaded mesopotamia under antiochus vii sidetes (r. 138–129 bc), but he was eventually killed by a parthian counterattack.
after the fall of the seleucid dynasty, the parthians fought frequently against neighbouring rome in the roman–parthian wars (66 bc – 217 ad).
the parthians continued worhipping greek gods syncretized together with iranian deities.
its capital was the city of petra, an important trading city on the incense route.
during the hellenistic period, judea became a frontier region between the seleucid empire and ptolemaic egypt and therefore was often the frontline of the syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts.
between 301 and 219 bce the ptolemies ruled judea in relative peace, and jews often found themselves working in the ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a hellenized jewish elite class (e.g. the tobiads).
diodotus ii, son of diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 bc by euthydemus, possibly the satrap of sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty.
the resulting indo-scythian kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining indo-greek kingdom towards the east.
several references in indian literature praise the knowledge of the yavanas or the greeks.
in arabia, bahrain, which was referred to by the greeks as tylos, the centre of pearl trading, when nearchus came to discover it serving under alexander the great.
the end result was the complete conquest of sicily, including its previously powerful greek cities, by the romans.
this ended with a decisive roman victory at the battle of cynoscephalae (197 bc).
in 146 bc, the greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a roman protectorate.
the attalid dynasty of pergamum lasted little longer; a roman ally until the end, its final king attalus iii died in 133 bc without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed pergamum to the roman republic.
eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the seleucid empire caused the roman proconsul pompey the great to abolish the seleucid rump state, absorbing much of syria into the roman republic.
after the defeat of anthony and his lover, the last ptolemaic monarch, cleopatra vii at the battle of actium, augustus invaded egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom.

an example that shows the spread of greek theater is plutarch's story of the death of crassus, in which his head was taken to the parthian court and used as a prop in a performance of the bacchae.
gymnasiums and their greek education, for example, were for greeks only.
it is only until cleopatra vii, that a ptolemaic ruler bothered to learn the egyptian language of their subjects.
this varied greatly on location, athens, sparta and most cities in the greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods (with the exception of the egyptian isis in athens), while the multi-ethnic alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including egyptian, jewish and greek.
a common practice was to identify greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like zeus-ammon, aphrodite hagne (a hellenized atargatis) and isis-demeter.
the worship of alexander was also popular, as in the long lived cult at erythrae and of course, at alexandria, where his tomb was located.
the apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth.
though no hellenistic tragedy remains intact, they were still widely produced during the period, yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style, remaining within the classical model.
in this political climate, hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia (un-disturbedness), autarky (self-sufficiency) and apatheia (freedom from suffering), which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune.

stoicism, founded by zeno of citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with nature or logos.
it has recently been claimed that a celestial globe based on hipparchus's star catalog sits atop the broad shoulders of a large 2nd-century roman statue known as the farnese atlas.
seleucus received indian war elephants from the mauryan empire, and used them to good effect at the battle of ipsus.
hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos).
though this comparison is now seen as unfair and meaningless, it has been noted that even commentators of the time saw the end of a cultural era which could not be matched again.
on june 25, 2006, warren buffett (then the world's richest person, estimated worth of us$62 billion as of april 16, 2008) pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million berkshire hathaway class b shares spread over multiple years through annual contributions, with the first year's donation of 500,000 shares being worth approximately us$1.5 billion.
the foundation explains on its website that its trustees divided the organization into two entities: the bill & melinda gates foundation (foundation) and the bill & melinda gates foundation trust (trust).
the trust section manages "the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation's charitable goals"—it holds the assets of bill and melinda gates, who are the sole trustees, and receives contributions from buffett.
at the time that the results were released, the ijm was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions.
in mid 2011, the foundation announced in its new "water, sanitation, hygiene strategy overview" that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation, particularly in sub-saharan africa and south asia, because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions.
the k-12 and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals, parents, and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support gates' predetermined policy preferences.

banking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in uruguay: the country was once dubbed "the switzerland of america", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate.
the reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in august of that year.
parque batlle (formerly: parque de los aliados, translation: "park of the allies") is a major public central park, located south of avenida italia and north of avenue rivera.
it has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income.
parque batlle is named in honour of josé batlle y ordóñez, president of uruguay from 1911 to 1915.
parque rodó is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to punta carretas.
the park was conceived as a french-style city park.
the first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the portuguese at montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the spaniards emanating from buenos aires.

the first public library in montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of father josé manuel pérez castellano, who died in 1815.
in montevideo, as throughout the rio de plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo.
the palace was designed by french architects charles louis girault and jules chifflot león who also designed the petit palais and the arc de triomphe in paris.
the national museum of visual arts in parque rodó has uruguay's largest collection of paintings.
the museo y parque fernando garcía in carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles.
notable displays include "desfile de las llamadas" ("parade of the calls"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century.
in 1836, the house of general studies was formed, housing the departments of latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence.

the state railways administration of uruguay (afe) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the empalme olmos, san jose and florida.
males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens).
in about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the united kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the united states soon after the second world war.
a bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a "true bantam" with no larger counterpart.
the sport formed part of the culture of the ancient indians, chinese, greeks, and romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter.
the greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production.
the modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six subspecies of wild turkey (meleagris gallopavo) found in the present mexican states of jalisco, guerrero and veracruz.
these are often large buildings, purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities (this reduces the birds' activity and thereby increases the rate of weight gain).
these were the common quail (coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of japanese quail (coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century ad in japan.
worldwide, more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs.
in these, several birds share a small cage which restricts their ability to move around and behave in a normal manner.
breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size (2 kg (4.4 lb)) in six weeks or less.
sometimes, poultry shows are part of general livestock shows, and sometimes they are separate events such as the annual "national championship show" in the united kingdom organised by the poultry club of great britain.
there are two distinct models of production; the european union supply chain model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin.
other notable duck-producing countries in the far east include vietnam, thailand, malaysia, myanmar, indonesia and south korea (12% in total).
a 2011 study by the translational genomics research institute showed that 47% of the meat and poultry sold in united states grocery stores was contaminated with staphylococcus aureus, and 52% of the bacteria concerned showed resistance to at least three groups of antibiotics.
it derived from the old germanic word theudisk, one of the first names ever used for the non-romance languages of western europe, meaning (pertaining to the language) of the people, that is, the native germanic language.
this designation had been in use as far back as the end of the 15th century, but received competition from the more popular terminology nederduits, "low dutch", for several reasons.
the term nederduits, however introduced new confusion, since the non standardised dialects spoken in the north of germany came to be known as niederdeutsch as well, and thus the duits reference in the name was dropped, leading to nederlands as designation to refer to the dutch language.
dutch is together with english and german part of the west germanic group, that is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in north and east germanic.
the process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of antwerp.
in 1585 antwerp fell to the spanish army: many fled to the northern netherlands, where the dutch republic declared its independence from spain.
therefore, the situation in belgium is essentially no different from that in the netherlands, although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation, comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard british and standard american english.
dialect borders of these dialects do not correspond to present political boundaries, but reflect older, medieval divisions.
west flemish is also spoken in zeelandic flanders (part of the dutch province of zeeland), and by older people in french flanders (a small area that borders belgium).
many native speakers of dutch, both in belgium and the netherlands, assume that afrikaans and west frisian are dialects of dutch but are considered separate and distinct from dutch: a daughter language and a sister language, respectively.
however, it is still largely mutually intelligible with dutch. (
in europe, dutch is the majority language in the netherlands (96%) and belgium (59%) as well as a minority language in germany and northern france's french flanders, where it is in the ultimate stage of language death.
in northeastern france, the area around calais was historically dutch-speaking (west flemish) of which an estimated 20,000 daily speakers.
in the last quarter of the 19th century, however, a local elite gained proficiency in dutch so as to meet the needs of expanding bureaucracy and business.
suriname gained its independence from the netherlands in 1975 and has been an associate member of the dutch language union since 2004.
stroop theorizes that the lowering of open-mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically "natural" and inevitable development and that dutch, after having diphthongised the long high vowels like german and english, "should" have lowered the diphthongs like german and english as well.
instead, he argues, this development has been artificially frozen in an "intermediate" state by the standardisation of dutch pronunciation in the 16th century, where lowered diphthongs found in rural dialects were perceived as ugly by the educated classes and accordingly declared substandard.
this gender system is similar to those of most continental scandinavian languages.
a subordinate clause does not change its word order: "kun jij je pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is?" ("
the former take an diminutive ending and thus functions as a noun, the latter remain adverbs and have always the diminutive with the -s appended, e.g. adjective: groen ("green") → noun: groentje ("rookie"); adverb: even ("just") → adverb: eventjes ("just a minute").
there is one exception: the standard language prescribes that in the third person plural, hen is to be used for the direct object, and hun for the indirect object.
this distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by dutch speakers.
the original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of sir charles long.
needing money, james i sold off part of the crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (
possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a sir william blake, around 1624.
the next owner was lord goring, who from 1633 extended blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as goring great garden.
buckingham house was eventually sold by buckingham's descendant, sir charles sheffield, in 1761 to george iii for £21,000.
buckingham palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of queen victoria, who was the first monarch to reside there; her predecessor william iv had died before its completion.
by 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by edward blore, was built by thomas cubitt, enclosing the central quadrangle.
the ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by nash's student sir james pennethorne.
under victoria, buckingham palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the usual royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.
there are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.
there are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.
at the centre of this suite is the bow room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the queen's garden parties in the gardens.
this is a chinese-style saloon enhanced by queen mary, who, working with the designer sir charles allom, created a more "binding" chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from brighton in 1873.

the palace's state rooms have been open to the public during august and september and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993.
following their accession in 1936, king george vi and his consort, queen elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise.
after world war i, when queen mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction.
also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions.

the british pilot became a king's messenger after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.
an upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy (ler) is around 52 lumens per watt, the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point.
white-balancing is still required to avoid too "warm" or "cool" colors, but this is a simple process that requires only the color temperature in kelvin as input for modern, digital visual reproduction equipment such as video or still cameras unless it is completely automated.
although inefficient, incandescent light bulbs have an advantage in applications where accurate color reproduction is important, since the continuous blackbody spectrum emitted from an incandescent light-bulb filament yields near-perfect color rendition, with a color rendering index of 100 (the best possible).
there are many non-incandescent light sources, such as the fluorescent lamp, high-intensity discharge lamps and led lamps, which have higher luminous efficiency, and some have been designed to be retrofitted in fixtures for incandescent lights.
since incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as cfls and led lamps, many governments have introduced measures to ban their use, by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps.
objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps.
however, even though they contain mercury, the environmental performance of cfls is much better than that of light bulbs, mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production.
it however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.
this transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament.
for a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually 22.8 inches (580 mm), and the filament diameter is 0.0018 inches (0.046 mm).
lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to ac operation; different alloys of tungsten and rhenium can be used to counteract the effect.
at constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules.
such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space.
for two bulbs of the same voltage, type, color, and clarity, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.
early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours.
the "centennial light" is a light bulb that is accepted by the guinness book of world records as having been burning almost continuously at a fire station in livermore, california, since 1901.
in the 1930s, arsenal won five league championships and two fa cups, and another fa cup and two championships after the war.
arsenal appointed herbert chapman as manager in 1925.
his revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as alex james and cliff bastin, laid the foundations of the club's domination of english football in the 1930s.
this marked a premature high point of the decade; the double-winning side was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with arsenal finishing as fa cup runners up in 1972, and first division runners-up in 1972–73.
arsenal reached the final of the 2007 and 2011 league cups, losing 2–1 to chelsea and birmingham city respectively.
unveiled in 1888, royal arsenal's first crest featured three cannon viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the coat of arms of the metropolitan borough of woolwich (nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the royal borough of greenwich).
the oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the royal oak pub.
the shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.
in 1933, herbert chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red.
in the 1969–70 season, arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts.
the arsenal supporters' trust promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans.
arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, tottenham hotspur; matches between the two are referred to as north london derbies.
in addition, arsenal and manchester united developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the premier league title – so much so that a 2003 online poll by the football fans census listed manchester united as arsenal's biggest rivals, followed by tottenham and chelsea.
as of june 2015, kroenke owns 41,698 shares (67.02%) and red & white securities own 18,695 shares (30.04%).
only 62,217 shares in arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the ftse or aim; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the icap securities and derivatives exchange, a specialist market.
more recently, the book fever pitch by nick hornby was an autobiographical account of hornby's life and relationship with football and arsenal in particular.
arsenal's tally of 13 league championships is the third highest in english football, after manchester united (20) and liverpool (18), and they were the first club to reach 8 league championships.
humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards.
they cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes.
ralf kittler, manfred kayser and mark stoneking, anthropologists at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology, have conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago.
the process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading western culture and styles.
researchers in scientific labs have been developing prototypes for fabrics that can serve functional purposes well beyond their traditional roles, for example, clothes that can automatically adjust their temperature, repel bullets, project images, and generate electricity.

in 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.
as a result, chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by 1890 they had become known as the chicago colts, or sometimes "anson's colts", referring to cap's influence within the club.
the shift in the cubs' fortunes was characterized june 23 on the "nbc saturday game of the week" contest against the st. louis cardinals.
thus the first two games were played at wrigley field and the next three at the home of their opponents, san diego.
the season started with mack newton being brought in to preach "positive thinking."
there is speculation as to whether the "facts" surrounding the story are true or not, but nevertheless ruth did help the yankees secure a world series win that year and the home run accounted for his 15th and last home run in the post season before he retired in 1935.

the chicago white stockings, (today's chicago cubs), began spring training in hot springs, arkansas in 1886.
wrigley constructed a ballpark on the island to house the cubs in spring training: it was built to the same dimensions as wrigley field. (
apart from hohokam park and sloan park the cubs also have another mesa training facility called fitch park, this complex provides 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2) of team facilities, including major league clubhouse, four practice fields, one practice infield, enclosed batting tunnels, batting cages, a maintenance facility, and administrative offices for the cubs.

after these dramatic reversals of fortune, which saw seoul change hands four times, the last two years of conflict became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th parallel.
in china, the war is officially called the "war to resist u.s. aggression and aid korea" (simplified chinese: 抗美援朝战争; traditional chinese: 抗美援朝戰爭; pinyin: kàngměiyuáncháo zhànzhēng), although the term "chaoxian (korean) war" (simplified chinese: 朝鲜战争; traditional chinese: 朝鮮戰爭; pinyin: cháoxiǎn zhànzhēng) is also used in unofficial contexts, along with the term "korean conflict" (simplified chinese: 韩战; traditional chinese: 韓戰; pinyin: hán zhàn) more commonly used in regions such as hong kong and macau.
korea was considered to be part of the empire of japan as an industrialized colony along with taiwan, and both were part of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere.
by january 1945, koreans made up 32% of japan's labor force.
it was marred by terrorism and sabotage resulting in 600 deaths.
as a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 korean veterans that served in the pla were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of south korea.
kim met with mao in may 1950.
on the eve of war, kmag's commander general william lynn roberts voiced utmost confidence in the rok army and boasted that any north korean invasion would merely provide "target practice".
on 4 july the soviet deputy foreign minister accused the united states of starting armed intervention on behalf of south korea.
the impact of the truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as american troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions.
acting on state secretary acheson's recommendation, president truman ordered general macarthur to transfer matériel to the army of the republic of korea while giving air cover to the evacuation of u.s. nationals.
the battle of osan, the first significant american engagement of the korean war, involved the 540-soldier task force smith, which was a small forward element of the 24th infantry division which had been flown in from japan.
in their southward advance, the kpa purged the republic of korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals.
against the rested and re-armed pusan perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the kpa were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the un command, they lacked naval and air support.
by 1 october 1950, the un command repelled the kpa northwards past the 38th parallel; the rok army crossed after them, into north korea.
at month's end, un forces held 135,000 kpa prisoners of war.
on 17 october, they flanked rightwards, away from the principal road (to pyongyang), to capture hwangju.
to president truman, macarthur speculated there was little risk of chinese intervention in korea, and that the prc's opportunity for aiding the kpa had lapsed.
2914, 3 c.f.r. 99 (1953), which remained in force until 14 september 1978.[b] the next day (17 december 1950) kim il-sung was deprived of the right of command of kpa by china.
following that, on 1 february 1951, united nations general assembly adopted a draft resolution condemning china as an aggressor in the korean war.
with lieutenant-general matthew ridgway assuming the command of the u.s. eighth army on 26 december, the pva and the kpa launched their third phase offensive (also known as the "chinese new year's offensive") on new year's eve of 1950.
the pva had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond seoul as food, ammunition, and matériel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the yalu river to the three battle lines.
surrounded on all sides, the u.s. 2nd infantry division warrior division's 23rd regimental combat team with an attached french battalion was hemmed in by more than 25,000 chinese communist forces.
on 11 april 1951, commander-in-chief truman relieved the controversial general macarthur, the supreme commander in korea.
general ridgway was appointed supreme commander, korea; he regrouped the un forces for successful counterattacks, while general james van fleet assumed command of the u.s. eighth army.
the chinese counterattacked in april 1951, with the fifth phase offensive, also known as the chinese spring offensive, with three field armies (approximately 700,000 men).
the principal battles of the stalemate include the battle of bloody ridge (18 august–15 september 1951), the battle of the punchbowl (31 august-21 september 1951), the battle of heartbreak ridge (13 september–15 october 1951), the battle of old baldy (26 june–4 august 1952), the battle of white horse (6–15 october 1952), the battle of triangle hill (14 october–25 november 1952), the battle of hill eerie (21 march–21 june 1952), the sieges of outpost harry (10–18 june 1953), the battle of the hook (28–29 may 1953), the battle of pork chop hill (23 march–16 july 1953), and the battle of kumsong (13–27 july 1953).
at the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible.
speaking on 4 april 2013, the u.s. secretary of defense, chuck hagel, informed the press that pyongyang had "formally informed" the pentagon that it had "ratified" the potential usage of a nuclear weapon against south korea, japan and the united states of america, including guam and hawaii.
hagel also stated that the united states would deploy the terminal high altitude area defense anti-ballistic missile system to guam, because of a credible and realistic nuclear threat from north korea.
this known direct soviet participation was a casus belli that the un command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the korean peninsula expand to include the soviet union, and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.
copyright infringement is the use of works protected by copyright law without permission, infringing certain exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder, such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display or perform the protected work, or to make derivative works.
egregious or large-scale commercial infringement, especially when it involves counterfeiting, is sometimes prosecuted via the criminal justice system.
article 12 of the 1886 berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works uses the term "piracy" in relation to copyright infringement, stating "pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the union where the original work enjoys legal protection."
instead, "interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud.
cara cusumano, director of the tribeca film festival, stated in april 2014: "piracy is less about people not wanting to pay and more about just wanting the immediacy – people saying, 'i want to watch spiderman right now' and downloading it".
in response to cusumano's perspective, screen producers australia executive director matt deaner clarified the motivation of the film industry: "distributors are usually wanting to encourage cinema-going as part of this process [monetizing through returns] and restrict the immediate access to online so as to encourage the maximum number of people to go to the cinema."
in the u.s., copyright infringement is sometimes confronted via lawsuits in civil court, against alleged infringers directly, or against providers of services and software that support unauthorized copying.
the ruling gave rise to what became known as the "lamacchia loophole," wherein criminal charges of fraud or copyright infringement would be dismissed under current legal standards, so long as there was no profit motive involved.
however, in april 2014, the court of justice of the european union ruled that "national legislation which makes no distinction between private copies made from lawful sources and those made from counterfeited or pirated sources cannot be tolerated."
title i of the u.s. dmca, the wipo copyright and performances and phonograms treaties implementation act has provisions that prevent persons from "circumvent[ing] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work".
as different content was considered in different legal systems, and in the absence of common definitions for "isps," "bulletin boards" or "online publishers," early law on online intermediaries' liability varied widely from country to country.
the bittorrent protocol established an entirely decentralised network architecture in order to distribute large files effectively.
article 10 of the berne convention mandates that national laws provide for limitations to copyright, so that copyright protection does not extend to certain kinds of uses that fall under what the treaty calls "fair practice," including but not limited to minimal quotations used in journalism and education.
the dmca also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.
the dmca also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.
some copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, "open" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions.
in 2007, the institute for policy innovation (ipi) reported that music piracy took $12.5 billion from the u.s. economy.
the 2011 business software alliance piracy study standard, estimates the total commercial value of illegally copied software to be at $59 billion in 2010, with emerging markets accounting for $31.9 billion, over half of the total.
annexed by rome in the second century bc, greece became an integral part of the roman empire and its successor, the byzantine empire.
neolithic settlements in greece, dating from the 7th millennium bc, are the oldest in europe by several centuries, as greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the near east to europe.
this ushered in a period known as the greek dark ages, from which written records are absent.
nevertheless, much of greece clung tenaciously to paganism, and ancient greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century ad, when they were outlawed by the roman emperor theodosius i in 391-392.
the re-establishment of the byzantine imperial capital in constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empire's recovery of much of the greek peninsula, although the frankish principality of achaea in the peloponnese and the rival greek despotate of epirus in the north both remained important regional powers into the 14th century, while the islands remained largely under genoese and venetian control.
discrimination against christians, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local ottoman authorities, led to conversions to islam, if only superficially.
when military conflicts broke out between the ottoman empire and other states, greeks usually took arms against the empire, with few exceptions.
however, in the 18th century, there arose through shipping a wealthy and dispersed greek merchant class.
the first of these revolts began on 6 march 1821 in the danubian principalities under the leadership of alexandros ypsilantis, but it was soon put down by the ottomans.
after years of negotiation, three great powers, russia, the united kingdom and france, decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to greece.
corruption and trikoupis' increased spending to create necessary infrastructure like the corinth canal overtaxed the weak greek economy, forcing the declaration of public insolvency in 1893 and to accept the imposition of an international financial control authority to pay off the country's debtors.
in the aftermath of the first world war, greece attempted further expansion into asia minor, a region with a large native greek population at the time, but was defeated in the greco-turkish war of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of asia minor greeks.
following the catastrophic events in asia minor, the monarchy was abolished via a referendum in 1924 and the second hellenic republic was declared.

traditionally strained relations with neighbouring turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the greek veto against turkey's bid for eu membership.
according to the world wide fund for nature and the european environment agency, the territory of greece can be subdivided into six ecoregions: the illyrian deciduous forests, pindus mountains mixed forests, balkan mixed forests, rhodope montane mixed forests, aegean and western turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and crete mediterranean forests.
the constitution, which consists of 120 articles, provides for a separation of powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and grants extensive specific guarantees (further reinforced in 2001) of civil liberties and social rights.
additionally, due to its political and geographical proximity to europe, asia, the middle east and africa, greece is a country of significant geostrategic importance and is considered to be a middle power and has developed a regional policy to help promote peace and stability in the balkans, the mediterranean, and the middle east.
since the kallikratis programme reform entered into effect on 1 january 2011, greece has consisted of thirteen regions subdivided into a total of 325 municipalities.

there is also one autonomous area, mount athos (greek: agio oros, "holy mountain"), which borders the region of central macedonia.
important greek industries include tourism (with 14.9 million international tourists in 2009, it is ranked as the 7th most visited country in the european union and 16th in the world by the united nations world tourism organization) and merchant shipping (at 16.2% of the world's total capacity, the greek merchant marine is the largest in the world), while the country is also a considerable agricultural producer (including fisheries) within the union.
with an economy larger than all the balkan economies combined, greece is the largest economy in the balkans, and an important regional investor.
greece is the number-two foreign investor of capital in albania, the number-three foreign investor in bulgaria, at the top-three of foreign investors in romania and serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor of the republic of macedonia.
estimates of the recognized greek muslim minority, which is mostly located in thrace, range from 98,000 to 140,000, (about 1%) while the immigrant muslim community numbers between 200,000 and 300,000.
during the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the greek language question, on whether the official language of greece should be the archaic katharevousa, created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the dimotiki, the form of the greek language which evolved naturally from byzantine greek and was the language of the people.
the dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when dimotiki was made the only official variation of the greek language, and katharevousa fell to disuse.
their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the greek-speaking majority.
paideia was one of the highest societal values in the greek and hellenistic world while the first european institution described as a university was founded in 5th century constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city's fall to the ottomans in 1453.
in 2010, there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country, but on 1 july 2011, the ministry for health and social solidarity announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds, as a necessary reform to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards.[disputed – discuss] greece's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of gdp were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 oecd report, just above the oecd average of 9.5%.
along with the byzantine (church) chant and music, the greek people also cultivated the greek folk song which is divided into two cycles, the akritic and klephtic.
in 2005, greece won with the song "my number one", performed by greek-swedish singer elena paparizou.
the greek national football team, ranking 12th in the world in 2014 (and having reached a high of 8th in the world in 2008 and 2011), were crowned european champions in euro 2004 in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the sport and became one of the most successful national teams in european football, being one of only nine national teams to have won the uefa european championship.
the principal gods of the ancient greek religion were the dodekatheon, or the twelve gods, who lived on the top of mount olympus.
the most important of all ancient greek gods was zeus, the king of the gods, who was married to hera, who was also zeus's sister.
1 may (labour day) and 28 october (ohi day) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off.
in 2011, it became apparent that the bail-out would be insufficient and a second bail-out amounting to €130 billion ($173 billion) was agreed in 2012, subject to strict conditions, including financial reforms and further austerity measures.
in april 2014, greece returned to the global bond market as it successfully sold €3 billion worth of five-year government bonds at a yield of 4.95%.
it has operations in over 90 countries, produces around 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has 44,000 service stations worldwide.
in november 2004, following a period of turmoil caused by the revelation that shell had been overstating its oil reserves, it was announced that the shell group would move to a single capital structure, creating a new parent company to be named royal dutch shell plc, with its primary listing on the london stock exchange, a secondary listing on the amsterdam stock exchange, its headquarters and tax residency in the hague, netherlands and its registered office in london.
in february 2010 shell and cosan formed a 50:50 joint-venture, raízen, comprising all of cosan's brazilian ethanol, energy generation, fuel distribution and sugar activities, and all of shell's brazilian retail fuel and aviation distribution businesses.
following the sale of the majority of its australian assets in february 2014, the corporation plans to sell a further us$15 billion worth of assets in the period leading up to 2015, with deals announced in australia, brazil and italy.
downstream operations, which now also includes the chemicals business, generates a third of shell's profits worldwide and is known for its global network of more than 40,000 petrol stations and its 47 oil refineries.
however, in 1984, royal dutch shell made a bid to purchase those shares of shell oil company it did not own (around 30%) and despite opposition from some minority shareholders, which led to a court case, shell completed the buyout for a sum of $5.7 billion.
at a general body meeting, held on 1 august 2014, 72 percent of shareholders voted to approve the buy-back, short of the 75 percent vote that was required for approval.
following the purchase of an offshore lease in 2005, shell initiated its us$4.5 billion arctic drilling program in 2006, after the corporation purchased the "kulluk" oil rig and leased the noble discoverer drillship.
in particular, shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of ken saro-wiwa and eight other leaders of the ogoni tribe of southern nigeria, who were hanged in 1995 by nigeria's then military rulers.
in 2009, shell agreed to pay $15.5m in a legal settlement.
on 16 march 2012, 52 greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded fennica and nordica, multipurpose icebreakers chartered to support shell's drilling rigs near alaska.
according to greenpeace, shell lodged a request with google to ban video footage of a greenpeace protest action that occurred at the shell-sponsored formula one (f1) belgian grand prix on 25 august 2013, in which "savethearctic.org" banners appear at the winners' podium ceremony.
in the video, the banners rise up automatically—activists controlled their appearance with the use of four radio car antennas—revealing the website url, alongside an image that consists of half of a polar bear's head and half of the shell logo.
mammals include the largest animals on the planet, the rorquals and other large whales, as well as some of the most intelligent, such as elephants, primates, including humans, and cetaceans.
mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter (108 ft) blue whale.
the first amniotes apparently arose in the late carboniferous.
they descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods, which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as by ferns, mosses and other plants.
in the early triassic, all the medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which, over an extended period of time (35 million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs, the pterosaurs, and the dinosaurs.
the oldest known fossil among the eutheria ("true beasts") is the small shrewlike juramaia sinensis, or "jurassic mother from china", dated to 160 million years ago in the late jurassic.

this tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams (0.7–1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm.
during exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully.
in particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.
soon after the defeat of the spanish armada in 1588, london merchants presented a petition to queen elizabeth i for permission to sail to the indian ocean.
and in march 1604 sir henry middleton commanded the second voyage.
the company established trading posts in surat (1619), madras (1639), bombay (1668), and calcutta (1690).
this allowed any english firm to trade with india, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years.
in 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the british government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in india until 1783, in return for a further loan of £1 million.
again in 1673, banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company.
the highest rank to which an indian soldier could aspire was subadar-major (or rissaldar-major in cavalry units), effectively a senior subaltern equivalent.
in addition, penang, one of the states in malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's indian territories.
the shield had as a crest: "a sphere without a frame, bounded with the zodiac in bend or, between two pennants flottant argent, each charged with a cross gules, over the sphere the words deus indicat" (latin: god indicates).
this was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers and pirates on their voyages to india and china (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy.
lastly, on 15 june 1795, the general goddard played a large role in the capture of seven dutch east indiamen off st helena.
in 677 (during the reign of emperor gaozong), chen zheng (陳政), together with his son chen yuanguang (陳元光), led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in fujian.
they settled in zhangzhou and brought the middle chinese phonology of northern china during the 7th century into zhangzhou; in 885, (during the reign of emperor xizong of tang), the two brothers wang chao (王潮) and wang shenzhi (王審知), led a military expedition force to pacify the huang chao rebellion.
the existence of literary and colloquial readings (文白異讀), called tha̍k-im (讀音), is a prominent feature of some hokkien dialects and indeed in many sinitic varieties in the south.
in 2001, the local taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in taiwan, and taiwanese hokkien became one of the compulsory local taiwanese languages to be learned in schools.
another is a ming dynasty script of a play called romance of the lychee mirror (1566), supposedly the earliest southern min colloquial text.
all latin characters required by pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using unicode (or the corresponding iso/iec 10646: universal character set), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters.
in 2002, the taiwan solidarity union, a party with about 10% of the legislative yuan seats at the time, suggested making taiwanese a second official language.
due to its persistent cultural presence and to its novelty within the performing arts, wrestling constitutes a recurring topic in both academia and the media.
other prominent professional wrestling companies worldwide include the us-based total nonstop action wrestling (tna) and ring of honor (roh), consejo mundial de lucha libre (cmll) and asistencia asesoría y administración (aaa) in mexico, and the japanese new japan pro wrestling (njpw), all japan pro wrestling (ajpw), and pro wrestling noah (noah) leagues.
gradually, the predetermined nature of professional wrestling became an open secret, as prominent figures in the wrestling business (including wwe owner vince mcmahon) began to publicly admit that wrestling was entertainment, not competition.
despite the public admission of the theatrical nature of professional wrestling, many u.s. states still regulate professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports.
this leads to a high level of audience participation; in fact, their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds.
most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls, with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner.
these matches are given a time limit; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw.
face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers, particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler themselves or a famous martial artist (such as tito ortiz in the main event at tna's thard justice in 2005).
the other two are positioned in the corner, and tags can be made between any two wrestlers.
one of the most mainstream examples of this is the four-corner match, the most common type of match in the wwe before it was replaced with its equivalent fatal four-way; four wrestlers, each for themselves, fight in a match, but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time.
most holds leave an arm or leg free, so that the person can tap out if they want.
a professional wrestling match can end in a draw.
in latin america and english-speaking countries, most wrestlers (and other on-stage performers) portray character roles, sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own.
some can be unrealistic and cartoon-like (such as doink the clown), while others carry more verisimilitude and can be seen as exaggerated versions of the performer's real life personality (such as chris jericho, the rock, john cena, stone cold steve austin, and cm punk).
a manager role may also be filled by a "valet", typically an appealing female who may participate in love triangle storylines, "damsel in distress" situations, and scripted fights with female wrestlers.
in general, a wrestler with multiple title reigns or an extended title reign is indicative of a wrestler's ability to maintain audience interest and/or a wrestler's ability to perform in the ring.
in japan, professional wrestling done by female wrestlers is called joshi puroresu (女子プロレス) or joshi puro for short.
for many decades (and still to a lesser extent today), performers were expected to keep the illusions of wrestling's legitimacy alive even while not performing, essentially acting in character any time they were in public.
the massachusetts institute of technology developed a course of study on the cultural significance of professional wrestling, and anthropologist heather levi has written an ethnography about the culture of lucha libre in mexico.
while pro wrestling is often described simplistically as a "soap opera for males", it has also been cited as filling the role of past forms of literature and theatre; a synthesis of classical heroics, commedia dell'arte, revenge tragedies, morality plays, and burlesque.
many of the injuries that occur in pro wrestling are shoulders, knee, back, neck, and rib injuries.
system was devised by the german astronomer julius scheiner (1858–1913) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography.
speed was expressed in degrees scheiner, originally ranging from 1° sch.
still, it remained difficult for manufactures to reliably determine film speeds, often only by comparing with competing products, so that an increasing number of modified semi-scheiner-based systems started to spread, which no longer followed scheiner's original procedures and thereby defeated the idea of comparability.
before the advent of the asa system, the system of weston film speed ratings was introduced by edward faraday weston (1878–1971) and his father dr. edward weston (1850–1936), a british-born electrical engineer, industrialist and founder of the us-based weston electrical instrument corporation, with the weston model 617, one of the earliest photo-electric exposure meters, in august 1932.
other models used the original weston scale up until ca.
film speed is found from a plot of optical density vs. log of exposure for the film, known as the d–log h curve or hurter–driffield curve.
the standard specifies the measurement of light sensitivity of the entire digital camera system and not of individual components such as digital sensors, although kodak has reported using a variation to characterize the sensitivity of two of their sensors in 2001.
the recommended exposure index (rei) technique, new in the 2006 version of the standard, allows the manufacturer to specify a camera model’s ei choices arbitrarily.
two ratios are used, the 40:1 ("excellent image quality") and the 10:1 ("acceptable image quality") ratio.
these ratios have been subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm (178 dpi) when viewed at 25 cm (9.8 inch) distance.
it is located in the valley of mexico (valle de méxico), a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of mexico, at an altitude of 2,240 metres (7,350 ft).
as a stand-alone country, in 2013, mexico city would be the fifth-largest economy in latin america—five times as large as costa rica's and about the same size as peru's.
after years of demanding greater political autonomy, residents were given the right to directly elect a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral legislative assembly by popular vote in 1997.
many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to mexico city's nickname of "the city of palaces" given by alexander von humboldt.
the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo was signed in what is now the far north of the city.
it has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 metres (16,000 feet).
the warm period extends from march to may when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain.
the rainy season runs from june to october when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea.
originally much of the valley laid beneath the waters of lake texcoco, a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes.
the choice was official on november 18, 1824, and congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the zocalo.
this area was then separated from the state of mexico, forcing that state's government to move from the palace of the inquisition (now museum of mexican medicine) in the city to texcoco.
therefore, it was the president, representing the federation, who used to designate the head of government of the federal district, a position which is sometimes presented outside mexico as the "mayor" of mexico city.[citation needed] in the 1980s, given the dramatic increase in population of the previous decades, the inherent political inconsistencies of the system, as well as the dissatisfaction with the inadequate response of the federal government after the 1985 earthquake, residents began to request political and administrative autonomy to manage their local affairs.[citation needed] some political groups even proposed that the federal district be converted into the 32nd state of the federation.
while not fully equivalent to a municipality, the 16 boroughs have gained significant autonomy, and since 2000 their heads of government are elected directly by plurality (they were previously appointed by the head of government of the federal district).
given that mexico city is organized entirely as a federal district, most of the city services are provided or organized by the government of the federal district and not by the boroughs themselves, while in the constituent states these services would be provided by the municipalities.

presbyterianism is a part of the reformed tradition within protestantism which traces its origins to the british isles.
presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or "church order") and worship; often using a "book of order" to regulate common practice and order.
presbyterians place great importance upon education and lifelong learning.
above the sessions exist presbyteries, which have area responsibilities.
it was enacted as law by the scottish parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of presbyterian church legislation elsewhere.
the church was eventually organised by andrew melville along presbyterian lines to become the national church of scotland.
presbyterianism first officially arrived in colonial america in 1703 with the establishment of the first presbytery in philadelphia.
the biggest presbyterian church is the national presbyterian church in mexico (iglesia nacional presbiteriana de méxico), which has around 2,500,000 members and associates and 3000 congregations, but there are other small denominations like the associate reformed presbyterian church in mexico which was founded in 1875 by the associate reformed church in north america.
often the churches there have one main congregation and a number of prayer houses develop.
in addition there are many korean-american presbyterians in the united states, either with their own church sites or sharing space in pre-existing churches as is the case in australia, new zealand and even muslim countries such as saudi arabia with korean immigration.
english presbyterian missionary james laidlaw maxwell established the first presbyterian church in tainan in 1865.
the approval of women elders given in the 1960s has been rescinded in all states except new south wales, which has the largest membership.
the presbyterian church in vanuatu is the largest denomination in the country, with approximately one-third of the population of vanuatu members of the church.
thuringia generally accepted the protestant reformation, and roman catholicism was suppressed as early as 1520[citation needed]; priests who remained loyal to it were driven away and churches and monasteries were largely destroyed, especially during the german peasants' war of 1525.
thomas müntzer, a leader of some non-peaceful groups of this sect, was active in this city.
in 1930 thuringia was one of the free states where the nazis gained real political power.
smaller rates of decline than rural areas (many villages lost half of their population since 1950, whereas the biggest cities (erfurt and jena) keep growing).
overall, there are 115 to 120 men per 100 women in the 25–40 age group ("family founders") which has negative consequences for the birth ratio.
the thuringian primary school takes four years and most primary schools are all-day schools offering optional extracurricular activities in the afternoon.
while some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore, by the individualized nature of the organism, kill their prey, many only eat a small part of the plant.
animals may also be 'grazed' upon; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring.
while a grazing species such as an elephant may travel many kilometers in a single day, grazing on many plants in the process, parasites form very close associations with their hosts, usually having only one or at most a few in their lifetime.
a well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps, solitary insects living a free life as an adult, then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar.
a predator at the top of any food chain (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an apex predator; examples include the orca, sperm whale, anaconda, komodo dragon, tiger, lion, tiger shark, nile crocodile, and most eagles and owls—and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears.
furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order.
the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid.
aposematism, where organisms are brightly colored as a warning to predators, is the antithesis of camouflage.
eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its carrying capacity.
at least a few people, such as the donner party, are said to have resorted to it in desperation.
this factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species, but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance.
although the aim in this situation is to remove the introduced species entirely, keeping its abundance down is often the only possibility.
the company's first true editor, writer-artist joe simon, teamed with artist and emerging industry notable jack kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, captain america, in captain america comics #1 (march 1941).
timely also published one of humor cartoonist basil wolverton's best-known features, "powerhouse pepper", as well as a line of children's funny-animal comics featuring popular characters like super rabbit and the duo ziggy pig and silly seal.
modern marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of the fantastic four #1 (nov. 1961), broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status.
this applied to the amazing spider-man title in particular, which turned out to be marvel's most successful book.
in 1965, spider-man and the hulk were both featured in esquire magazine's list of 28 college campus heroes, alongside john f. kennedy and bob dylan.
in 1965, spider-man and the hulk were both featured in esquire magazine's list of 28 college campus heroes, alongside john f. kennedy and bob dylan.
in addition to spider-man and the fantastic four, marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the hulk, thor, ant-man, iron man, the x-men, daredevil, the inhumans, black panther, doctor strange, captain marvel and the silver surfer, and such memorable antagonists as doctor doom, magneto, galactus, loki, the green goblin, and doctor octopus, all existing in a shared reality known as the marvel universe, with locations that mirror real-life cities such as new york, los angeles and chicago.
some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its curtis magazines imprint.
marvel held its own comic book convention, marvelcon '75, in spring 1975, and promised a marvelcon '76.
in october 1976, marvel, which already licensed reprints in different countries, including the uk, created a superhero specifically for the british market.
in 1996, marvel had some of its titles participate in "heroes reborn", a crossover that allowed marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the avengers and the fantastic four, and outsource them to the studios of two of the former marvel artists turned image comics founders, jim lee and rob liefeld.

the relaunched titles, which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream marvel universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry, but marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run and returned the characters to the marvel universe proper.
as the industry's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies, the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in north america, diamond comic distributors inc. in early 1997, when marvel's heroes world endeavor failed, diamond also forged an exclusive deal with marvel—giving the company its own section of its comics catalog previews.
on august 31, 2009, the walt disney company announced a deal to acquire marvel comics' parent corporation, marvel entertainment, for $4 billion or $4.2 billion, with marvel shareholders to receive $30 and 0.745 disney shares for each share of marvel they own.
also saw the debut of new flagship titles including uncanny avengers and all-new x-men.
also in march, marvel announced its marvel reevolution initiative that included infinite comics, a line of digital comics, marvel ar, an application software that provides an augmented reality experience to readers and marvel now!,
marvel first licensed two prose novels to bantam books, who printed the avengers battle the earth wrecker by otto binder (1967) and captain america: the great gold steal by ted white (1968).
this clause has allowed walt disney world to have meet and greets, merchandise, attractions and more with other marvel characters not associated with the characters at islands of adventures, such as star-lord and gamora from guardians of the galaxy as well as baymax and hiro from big hero 6.
by 1922 the british empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the earth's total land area.
cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the european discovery of america, and although he successfully made landfall on the coast of newfoundland (mistakenly believing, like christopher columbus, that he had reached asia), there was no attempt to found a colony.
bermuda was settled and claimed by england as a result of the 1609 shipwreck there of the virginia company's flagship, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed somers isles company.
in 1695, the scottish parliament granted a charter to the company of scotland, which established a settlement in 1698 on the isthmus of panama.
this occurred in 1707 with the treaty of union, establishing the kingdom of great britain.
the 18th century saw england (after 1707, britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and france becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.
events in america influenced british policy in canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated loyalists had migrated from america following independence.
with support from the british abolitionist movement, parliament enacted the slave trade act in 1807, which abolished the slave trade in the empire.
from its base in india, the company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to china since the 1730s.
in 1839, the confiscation by the chinese authorities at canton of 20,000 chests of opium led britain to attack china in the first opium war, and resulted in the seizure by britain of hong kong island, at that time a minor settlement.
the following year the british government dissolved the company and assumed direct control over india through the government of india act 1858, establishing the british raj, where an appointed governor-general administered india and queen victoria was crowned the empress of india.
with french, belgian and portuguese activity in the lower congo river region undermining orderly incursion of tropical africa, the berlin conference of 1884–85 was held to regulate the competition between the european powers in what was called the "scramble for africa" by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.
a third bill was passed by parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the first world war leading to the 1916 easter rising.

the british declaration of war on germany and its allies also committed the colonies and dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support.
the anglo-irish war ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the anglo-irish treaty, creating the irish free state, a dominion within the british empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the british crown.
this resulted in the 1951 anzus pact between australia, new zealand and the united states of america.
the british mandate of palestine, where an arab majority lived alongside a jewish minority, presented the british with a similar problem to that of india.
the matter was complicated by large numbers of jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to palestine following the holocaust, while arabs were opposed to the creation of a jewish state.
brunei, which had been a british protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union and maintained its status until independence in 1984.
the events at suez wounded british national pride, leading one mp to describe it as "britain's waterloo" and another to suggest that the country had become an "american satellite".
britain's last colony on the american mainland, british honduras, became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed belize in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981.
efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of carl linnaeus that remains in use to this day.
another work from ancient greece that made an early impact on botany is de materia medica, a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by greek physician and pharmacologist pedanius dioscorides.

botanical gardens came much later to northern europe; the first in england was the university of oxford botanic garden in 1621.
in 1665, using an early microscope, polymath robert hooke discovered cells, a term he coined, in cork, and a short time later in living plant tissue.
modern molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on dna sequences as data.
lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibers that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood.
vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress.
the goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.
plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources.
particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and giving rise to clonal populations genetically identical to the parent.
most sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis.
agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil rhizosphere bacterium, can attach to plant cells and infect them with a callus-inducing ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease.
epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying dna sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.
there are many differences between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves.
plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life.
respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.
minerals and water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the transpiration stream.
sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported by a variety of processes.
plant anatomy is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas plant morphology is the study of their external form.
the shoots consist of stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves and reproductive structures.
the root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system.
the scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single world-wide name for each organism.
the evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its phylogeny.
judging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently.
the difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to.
technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.

her performance led to a saturn award nomination for best actress.
while shooting the film, madonna began a relationship with beatty, which dissolved by the end of 1990.
the releases of her sexually explicit films, albums and book, and the aggressive appearance on letterman all made critics question madonna as a sexual renegade.

the dispute was resolved when the maverick shares, owned by madonna and ronnie dashev, were purchased by warner.
it was also revealed that the singer had signed a three-album deal with interscope records, who would act as the distributor in partnership with her 360 deal with live nation.
after visiting her hometown of detroit during may 2014, madonna decided to contribute funds to three of the city's organizations, to help eliminate poverty from there.
in the beginning of the '80's, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to erlewine, madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music.
in true blue, she incorporated classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.
in 1999, madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film music of the heart, before eventually leaving the project.
in 1985, madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "these boots are made for walkin'" by nancy sinatra; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".

the music video of the song "bedtime story" featured images inspired by the paintings of kahlo and remedios varo.
madonna's initial music videos reflected her american and hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.
to allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth.
laura barcella in her book madonna and me: women writers on the queen of pop (2012) wrote that "really, madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye."
according to fouz-hernández, subsequent female singers such as britney spears, christina aguilera, kylie minogue, the spice girls, destiny's child, jennifer lopez, and pink were like her "daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her."

according to lesbian feminist sheila jeffreys, madonna represents woman's occupancy of what monique wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women.
the law of the united states comprises many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law, of which the most important is the united states constitution, the foundation of the federal government of the united states.
the constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law, which consists of acts of congress, treaties ratified by the senate, regulations promulgated by the executive branch, and case law originating from the federal judiciary.
however, under the principle of stare decisis, no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute, and any court that does so will be reversed by the supreme court.
notably, a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute.

although the american law institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the restatement of torts, many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the restatements and to reject others.
some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception, such as the date of a colony's founding, while others are deliberately vague.
after the president signs a bill into law (or congress enacts it over his veto), it is delivered to the office of the federal register (ofr) of the national archives and records administration (nara) where it is assigned a law number, and prepared for publication as a slip law.
under the principle of chevron deference, regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes.
however, it is universally accepted that the founding fathers of the united states, by vesting "judicial power" into the supreme court and the inferior federal courts in article three of the united states constitution, thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent; this power was widely accepted, understood, and recognized by the founding fathers at the time the constitution was ratified.
federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law, which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law.
the fifty american states are separate sovereigns, with their own state constitutions, state governments, and state courts.
another unique feature is the so-called american rule under which parties generally bear their own attorneys' fees (as opposed to the english rule of "loser pays"), though american legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions.
generally, most felony convictions result in lengthy prison sentences as well as subsequent probation, large fines, and orders to pay restitution directly to victims; while misdemeanors may lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial fine.
to simplify the prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor crimes, some states have added a third level, infractions.

security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and general saw maung staged a coup d'état and formed the state law and order restoration council (slorc).
the military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the saffron revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the burmese government.
the series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi from house arrest, the establishment of the national human rights commission, the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners, new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes, a relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency practices.

in 2007 the german professor bassam tibi suggested that the rohingya conflict may be driven by an islamist political agenda to impose religious laws, while non-religious causes have also been raised, such as a lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the japanese occupation of burma in world war ii—during this time period the british allied themselves with the rohingya and fought against the puppet government of burma (composed mostly of bamar japanese) that helped to establish the tatmadaw military organisation that remains in power as of march 2013.
since the democratic transition began in 2011, there has been continuous violence as 280 people have been killed and 140,000 forced to flee from their homes in the rakhine state.
however, as explained by one editorial in the exiled press the irrawaddy, this new "freedom" has caused some burmese journalists to simply see the new law as an attempt to create an environment of self-censorship as journalists "are required to follow 16 guidelines towards protecting the three national causes — non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, perpetuation of sovereignty — and "journalistic ethics" to ensure their stories are accurate and do not jeopardise national security."

jews originated as a national and religious group in the middle east during the second millennium bce, in the part of the levant known as the land of israel.
although the israelites were divided into twelve tribes, the jews (being one offshoot of the israelites, another being the samaritans) are traditionally said to descend mostly from the israelite tribes of judah (from where the jews derive their ethnonym) and benjamin, and partially from the tribe of levi, who had together formed the ancient kingdom of judah, and the remnants of the northern kingdom of israel who migrated to the kingdom of judah and assimilated after the 720s bce, when the kingdom of israel was conquered by the neo-assyrian empire.
the babylonian exile ended in 539 bce when the achaemenid empire conquered babylon and cyrus the great allowed the exiled jews to return to yehud and rebuild their temple.
judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used.
according to historian shaye j. d. cohen, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the bible.
the fiscus judaicus, a tax imposed on jews in 70 ce and relaxed to exclude christians in 96 ce, also limited judaism's appeal.
ashkenazim, or "germanics" (ashkenaz meaning "germany" in hebrew), are so named denoting their german jewish cultural and geographical origins, while sephardim, or "hispanics" (sefarad meaning "spain/hispania" or "iberia" in hebrew), are so named denoting their spanish/portuguese jewish cultural and geographic origins.
ashkenazi jews represent the bulk of modern jewry, with at least 70% of jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to world war ii and the holocaust).
ashkenazi jews represent the bulk of modern jewry, with at least 70% of jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to world war ii and the holocaust).
elsewhere in the americas, there are also large jewish populations in canada (315,000), argentina (180,000-300,000), and brazil (196,000-600,000), and smaller populations in mexico, uruguay, venezuela, chile, colombia and several other countries (see history of the jews in latin america).
western europe's largest jewish community, and the third-largest jewish community in the world, can be found in france, home to between 483,000 and 500,000 jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from north african arab countries such as algeria, morocco, and tunisia (or their descendants).
methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent.
of the world's 15 million jews in 1939, more than a third were killed in the holocaust.

there is also a trend of orthodox movements pursuing secular jews in order to give them a stronger jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage.
as a result of the efforts by these and other jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been a trend (known as the baal teshuva movement) for secular jews to become more religiously observant, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown.
the use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 bc have been excavated in mexico and the indus valley civilization in ancient india (modern-day pakistan and some parts of india).
in persian poets' poems, especially ferdowsi's shahname, there are references to cotton ("panbe" in persian).
indian markets were increasingly forced to supply only raw cotton and, by british-imposed law, to purchase manufactured textiles from britain.[citation needed]
later, the invention of the james hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, richard arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and samuel crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled british spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates.
before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand.
genetically modified (gm) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides.
the subsequent introduction of a second variety of gm cotton led to increases in gm cotton production until 95% of the australian cotton crop was gm in 2009 making australia the country with the fifth largest gm cotton crop in the world.
organic cotton is generally understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified and that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizers or pesticides.
this program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.
most cotton in the united states, europe and australia is harvested mechanically, either by a cotton picker, a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant.

with the passage of the cotton research and promotion act of 1966, the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton.
the largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are china and india, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries.
dunavant enterprises, based in memphis, tennessee, is the leading cotton broker in africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents.
while brazil was fighting the us through the wto's dispute settlement mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed african countries – benin, burkina faso, chad, and mali – also known as "cotton-4" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of us cotton subsidies through negotiations.
once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties.
in 2010, two companies (monsanto and illumina), completed enough illumina sequencing to cover the d genome of g. raimondii about 50x.
in signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.
the process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression.
the design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.
lossless data compression algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy to represent data without losing any information, so that the process is reversible.
in lossy audio compression, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the audio signal.
there is a close connection between machine learning and compression: a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution) while an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history).
data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing: data differencing consists of producing a difference given a source and a target, with patching producing a target given a source and a difference, while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target, and decompression consists of producing a target given only a compressed file.
audio data compression, not to be confused with dynamic range compression, has the potential to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data.
audibility of spectral components calculated using the absolute threshold of hearing and the principles of simultaneous masking—the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency—and, in some cases, temporal masking—where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time.
other types of lossy compressors, such as the linear predictive coding (lpc) used with speech, are source-based coders.
often codecs create segments called a "frame" to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.)
in contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed.
in the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal).
the world's first commercial broadcast automation audio compression system was developed by oscar bonello, an engineering professor at the university of buenos aires.
for example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness.
compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in jpeg image compression.
roy greenslade issued some caveats over the may 2015 figures, but believes the weekday daily mail will overtake the sun in circulation during 2016.
he assured ipc that he would publish a "straightforward, honest newspaper" which would continue to support labour.
he was scathing in his opinion of the mirror, where he had recently been employed as a senior sub-editor, and shared murdoch's view that a paper's quality was best measured by its sales, and he regarded the mirror as overstaffed, and primarily aimed at an ageing readership.
it supported the labour party led by harold wilson in the 1970 general election, with the headline "why it must be labour" but by february 1974 it was calling for a vote for the conservative party led by edward heath while suggesting that it might support a labour party led by james callaghan or roy jenkins.
the daily star had been launched in 1978 by express newspaper, and by 1981 had begun to affect sales of the sun.
on 1 may, the sun claimed to have 'sponsored' a british missile.
under the headline "stick this up your junta: a sun missile for galtieri’s gauchos", the newspaper published a photograph of a missile, (actually a polaris missile stock shot from the ministry of defence) which had a large sun logo printed on its side with the caption "here it comes, senors..." underneath.
john shirley, a reporter for the sunday times, witnessed copies of this edition of the sun being thrown overboard by sailors and marines on hms fearless.
there are traitors in our midst", wrote leader writer ronald spark on 7 may, accusing commentators on daily mirror and the guardian, plus the bbc's defence correspondent peter snow, of "treason" for aspects of their coverage.
the sun, during the miners' strike of 1984–85, supported the police and the thatcher government against the striking num miners, and in particular the union's president, arthur scargill.
although many other british press services covered lord kilbracken's public comments, none of them made the argument that the sun did in its editorial and none of them presented lord kilbracken's ideas without context or criticism.
critics stated that both the sun and lord kilbracken cherry-picked the results from one specific study while ignoring other data reports on hiv infection and not just aids infection, which the critics viewed as unethical politicisation of a medical issue.

it was revealed in a documentary called alexei sayle's liverpool, aired in september 2008, that many liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free, and those who do may simply burn or tear it up.
despite its initial opposition to the closures, until 1997, the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further thatcherite policies, such as royal mail privatisation,[verification needed] and social security cutbacks, with leaders such as "peter lilley is right, we can't carry on like this",[verification needed] the paper showed hostility to the eu and approval of public spending cuts, tax cuts, and promotion of right-wing ministers to the cabinet, with leaders such as "more of the redwood, not deadwood".
john major's conservatives, it said, were "tired, divided and rudderless".
misjudging public response, the sun's editor david yelland demanded to know in a front page editorial whether britain was governed by a "gay mafia" of a "closed world of men with a mutual self-interest".
it did not help its argument by publishing a front page story on 4 july 2003, under the headline "swan bake", which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans.
in 2003 the paper was accused of racism by the government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the "open door" policy on immigration.
for the 2005 general election, the sun backed blair and labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him "one last chance" to fulfil his promises, despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration.

mahmood has been suspended pending an immediate internal investigation."
on 22 january 2015, the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges.
france’s trial followed the london metropolitan police's operation elveden, an ongoing investigation into alleged payments to police and officials in exchange for information.
in a statement released on 24 april 2015, high commissioner zeid ra'ad al hussein stated that hopkins' used "language very similar to that employed by rwanda's kangura newspaper and radio mille collines during the run up to the 1994 genocide", and noted that both media organizations were subsequently convicted by an international tribunal of public incitement to commit genocide.
hopkins' column also drew criticism on twitter, including from russell brand, to whom hopkins responded by accusing brand's "champagne socialist humanity" of neglecting taxpayers.
they are a class of biocide.
the most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, or insects.
target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors.
pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.
however, ddt and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity.
the world health organization and the un environment programme estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides, about 18,000 of whom die.
over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.
over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.
application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.
these methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides.
for example, sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.[unreliable source?]
in indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.[unreliable source?]
a study of maize fields in northern florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.
pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides, which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds, or persistent pesticides, which may take months or years before they are broken down: it was the persistence of ddt, for example, which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain.
nicosulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, and chlorsulfuron are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase.
three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the united nations london guidelines for the exchange of information on chemicals in international trade and the united nations codex alimentarius commission.[citation needed] the former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.
pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse, but do not eliminate all misuse.
new pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks.
since before 2000 bc, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops.
somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the blackdown hills, mendip hills, quantock hills and exmoor national park, and large flat expanses of land including the somerset levels.

the boundaries of somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times.
the largest urban areas in terms of population are bath, weston-super-mare, taunton, yeovil and bridgwater.
the levels are divided into two by the polden hills; land to the south is drained by the river parrett while land to the north is drained by the river axe and the river brue.
somerset is an important supplier of defence equipment and technology.
there are ministry of defence offices in bath, and norton fitzwarren is the home of 40 commando royal marines.
the towns of taunton and shepton mallet are involved with the production of cider, especially blackthorn cider, which is sold nationwide, and there are specialist producers such as burrow hill cider farm and thatchers cider.
c&j clark also had shoe factories, at one time at bridgwater, minehead, westfield and weston super mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at street.
a protest group, stop hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of hinkley point b and oppose any expansion at the hinkley point site.
the two unitary authorities — which were established on 1 april 1996 following the break-up of the short-lived county of avon — are north somerset, and bath & north east somerset.
the benedictine monastery saint gregory's abbey, commonly known as downside abbey, is at stratton-on-the-fosse, and the ruins of the former cistercian cleeve abbey are near the village of washford.
other visitor attractions which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include: claverton pumping station, dunster working watermill, the fleet air arm museum at yeovilton, nunney castle, the helicopter museum in weston-super-mare, king john's hunting lodge in axbridge, blake museum bridgwater, radstock museum, museum of somerset in taunton, the somerset rural life museum in glastonbury, and westonzoyland pumping station museum.
the usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though some have now been restored for recreation.
the county was served by five pre-1923 grouping railway companies: the great western railway (gwr); a branch of the midland railway (mr) to bath green park (and another one to bristol); the somerset and dorset joint railway, and the london and south western railway (l&swr).
until the 1960s the piers at weston-super-mare, clevedon, portishead and minehead were served by the paddle steamers of p and a campbell who ran regular services to barry and cardiff as well as ilfracombe and lundy island.
some schools have sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges.
other schools provide education for children from the age of 3 or 4 years through to 18, such as king edward's school, bath, queen's college, taunton and wells cathedral school which is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in britain.
the university of bath and bath spa university are higher education establishments in the north-east of the county.
the school was renamed yale college in 1718 in recognition of a gift from elihu yale, who was governor of the british east india company.
while the university is governed by the yale corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs.
soon thereafter, a group of ten congregationalist ministers: samuel andrew, thomas buckingham, israel chauncy, samuel mather, rev. james noyes ii (son of james noyes), james pierpont, abraham pierson, noadiah russell, joseph webb and timothy woodbridge, all alumni of harvard, met in the study of reverend samuel russell in branford, connecticut, to pool their books to form the school's library.
the revolutionary war soldier nathan hale (yale 1773) was the prototype of the yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who "regretted" that he "had but one life to lose" for his country.
increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.
one reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.
yale expanded gradually, establishing the yale school of medicine (1810), yale divinity school (1822), yale law school (1843), yale graduate school of arts and sciences (1847), the sheffield scientific school (1847), and the yale school of fine arts (1869).
levesque argues porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.
during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education.
the money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to "improve mankind" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort.
hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools.
the undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year; at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in vanderbilt hall at the south end of old campus.[citation needed]
under president levin, yale has financially supported many of new haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city.
yale president richard levin attributes the run to yale’s focus on creating "a laboratory for future leaders," an institutional priority that began during the tenure of yale presidents alfred whitney griswold and kingman brewster.
when challenged on the distinction between dukakis's harvard connection and his own yale background, he said that, unlike harvard, yale's reputation was "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, i don't think, in the yale situation, any symbolism in it" and said yale did not share harvard's reputation for "liberalism and elitism".
finally, yale security officers voted to join the international union of security, police and fire professionals of america in fall 2010 after the national labor relations board ruled they could not join afscme; the yale administration contested the election.

france and england experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the jacquerie and the peasants' revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict in the hundred years' war.
following a renewed interest in ancient greek and roman texts that took root in the high middle ages, the italian renaissance began.
europeans were forced to seek new trading routes, leading to the expedition of columbus to the americas in 1492, and vasco da gama’s circumnavigation of india and africa in 1498.
belgian historian henri pirenne continued the subdivision of early, high, and late middle ages in the years around world war i. yet it was his dutch colleague, johan huizinga, who was primarily responsible for popularising the pessimistic view of the late middle ages, with his book the autumn of the middle ages (1919).
to huizinga, whose research focused on france and the low countries rather than italy, despair and decline were the main themes, not rebirth.
the period from the early 14th century up until – and sometimes including – the 16th century, is rather seen as characterised by other trends: demographic and economic decline followed by recovery, the end of western religious unity and the subsequent emergence of the nation state, and the expansion of european influence onto the rest of the world.
yet this measure only led to further hostilities, and sweden broke away for good in 1523.
belgrade, an hungarian domain at the time, was the last large balkan city to fall under ottoman rule, in 1521.
yet serbian dominance was short-lived; the serbian army led by the lazar hrebljevanovic was defeated by the ottomans at the battle of kosovo in 1389, where most of the serbian nobility was killed and the south of the country came under ottoman occupation, as much of southern bulgaria had become ottoman territory in 1371.
northern remnants of bulgaria were finally conquered by 1396, serbia fell in 1459, bosnia in 1463, and albania was finally subordinated in 1479 only a few years after the death of skanderbeg.
portugal had during the 15th century – particularly under henry the navigator – gradually explored the coast of africa, and in 1498, vasco da gama found the sea route to india.
the effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in france during the hundred years' war.
the spirit of chivalry was given expression through the new (secular) type of chivalric orders; the first of these was the order of st. george, founded by charles i of hungary in 1325, while the best known was probably the english order of the garter, founded by edward iii in 1348.
martin luther, a german monk, started the german reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of wittenberg on october 31, 1517.
the period saw several important technical innovations, like the principle of linear perspective found in the work of masaccio, and later described by brunelleschi.
the application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of latin, and both dante and boccaccio wrote prolifically in latin as well as italian, as would petrarch later (whose canzoniere also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems).
prominent reformer of orthodox church music from the first half of 14th century was john kukuzelis; he also introduced a system of notation widely used in the balkans in the following centuries.
however, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is everyman.
also important were mummers' plays, performed during the christmas season, and court masques.
similarly, religious plays were banned in the netherlands in 1539, the papal states in 1547 and in paris in 1548.
at the end of the 15th century the ottoman empire advanced all over southeastern europe, eventually conquering the byzantine empire and extending control over the balkan states.

the landscape of ann arbor consists of hills and valleys, with the terrain becoming steeper near the huron river.
automobile manufacturers, such as general motors and visteon, also employ residents.
ann arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given ann arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called people's co-op, was directly across the street from michigan stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual hash bash: an event that is held on the first saturday of april.
the mayor and city council members serve two-year terms: the mayor is elected every even-numbered year, while half of the city council members are up for election annually (five in even-numbered and five in odd-numbered years).
on the state level, the city is part of the 18th district in the michigan senate, represented by democrat rebekah warren.
the ann arbor business review covers local business in the area.
it evolved from romanesque architecture and was succeeded by renaissance architecture.
it is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms.
it is in the great churches and cathedrals and in a number of civic buildings that the gothic style was expressed most powerfully, its characteristics lending themselves to appeals to the emotions, whether springing from faith or from civic pride.
the greatest number of surviving gothic buildings are churches.
on the other hand, some regions such as england and spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops.
certainly, in those parts of the western mediterranean subject to islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing romanesque and later gothic traditions with islamic decorative forms, as seen, for example, in monreale and cefalù cathedrals, the alcázar of seville, and teruel cathedral.
while barrel vaults and groin vaults are typical of romanesque architecture, ribbed vaults were used in the naves of two romanesque churches in caen, abbey of saint-étienne and abbaye aux dames in 1120.
the ribbed vault over the north transept at durham cathedral in england, built from 1128 to 1133, is probably earlier still and was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault.
to achieve his aims, his masons drew on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to romanesque architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed vault, the ambulatory with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large clerestory windows.
while german churches are often similar to those of france, in italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow apsidal chapel containing the sanctuary, as at florence cathedral.
the gothic vault, unlike the semi-circular vault of roman and romanesque buildings, can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as trapezoids.
the distinctive characteristic of french cathedrals, and those in germany and belgium that were strongly influenced by them, is their height and their impression of verticality.
the west window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables.
other italian cities such as florence (palazzo vecchio), mantua or venice also host remarkable examples of secular public architecture.
in 1663 at the archbishop of canterbury's residence, lambeth palace, a gothic hammerbeam roof was built to replace that destroyed when the building was sacked during the english civil war.
also in the late 17th century, some discrete gothic details appeared on new construction at oxford university and cambridge university, notably on tom tower at christ church, oxford, by christopher wren.
he effected vigorous restoration of crumbling detail of french cathedrals, including the abbey of saint-denis and famously at notre dame de paris, where many of whose most "gothic" gargoyles are viollet-le-duc's.
in other countries futurism, suprematism, dada, constructivism and de stijl developed in response to cubism.
in one scheme, the first phase of cubism, known as analytic cubism, a phrase coined by juan gris a posteriori, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in france.
the historical study of cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of guillaume apollinaire.
it is difficult to apply to painters such as jean metzinger, albert gleizes, robert delaunay and henri le fauconnier, whose fundamental differences from traditional cubism compelled kahnweiler to question their right to be called cubists at all.
already in 1910 a group began to form which included metzinger, gleizes, delaunay and léger.
juan gris, a new addition to the salon scene, exhibited his portrait of picasso (art institute of chicago), while metzinger's two showings included la femme au cheval (woman with a horse) 1911-1912 (national gallery of denmark).
it was against this background of public anger that jean metzinger and albert gleizes wrote du "cubisme" (published by eugène figuière in 1912, translated to english and russian in 1913).
in du "cubisme" metzinger and gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher henri bergson according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future.
a significant modification of cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity.
this grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector léonce rosenberg.
in their theoretical rules, the cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer.
as american poet kenneth rexroth explains, cubism in poetry "is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture.
legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws.
chanakya, 4th century bc indian political philosopher.
augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the city of god (civitas dei) or the city of man (civitas terrena).
the term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound.
political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade, and roman catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state, which also (in a fashion the roman catholic church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region.
another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by michael walzer, michael sandel and charles taylor.
a pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the capability approach.

one of the first alloys made by humans was bronze, which is made by mixing the metals tin and copper.
the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal.
sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide, which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel.
nearly all metals can be softened by annealing, which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling.
in the middle east, people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass.
native copper, however, was found worldwide, along with silver, gold and platinum, which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since neolithic times.
in ancient egypt and mycenae, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold.
in 1906, precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by alfred wilm.
in 1786 the british government included norfolk island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by john call, in its plan for colonisation of new south wales.
as early as 1794, lieutenant-governor of new south wales francis grose suggested its closure as a penal settlement, as it was too remote and difficult for shipping and too costly to maintain.
a small party remained to slaughter stock and destroy all buildings, so that there would be no inducement for anyone, especially from other european powers, to visit and lay claim to the place.
norfolk island is located in the south pacific ocean, east of the australian mainland.
all goods not domestically produced are brought in by ship, usually to cascade bay.
today, numbers of larger whales have disappeared, but even today many species such humpback whale, minke whale, sei whale, and dolphins can be observed close to shores, and scientific surveys have been conducted regularly.
norfolk island is the only non-mainland australian territory to have achieved self-governance.
four of the members of the assembly formed the executive council, which devised policy and acted as an advisory body to the administrator.
for serious emergencies, medical evacuations are provided by the royal australian air force.
there is a strong belief on the island that some of the revenue generated from norfolk's eez should be available to providing services such as health and infrastructure on the island, which the island has been responsible for, similar to how the northern territory is able to access revenue from their mineral resources.
in a move that apparently surprised many islanders the chief minister of norfolk island, david buffett, announced on 6 november 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts.
there is also one tv station, norfolk tv, featuring local programming, plus transmitters for australian channels abc, sbs, imparja television and southern cross television.
his mother mary née nagle (c. 1702 – 1770) was a roman catholic who hailed from a déclassé county cork family (and a cousin of nano nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, richard (died 1761), was a member of the church of ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same richard burke who converted from catholicism.
lord chesterfield and bishop warburton (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by bolingbroke rather than a satire.
whereas this vindication is everywhere enforc'd, not only in the language, and on the principles of l. bol.,
on 25 february 1757, burke signed a contract with robert dodsley to write a "history of england from the time of julius caesar to the end of the reign of queen anne", its length being eighty quarto sheets (640 pages), nearly 400,000 words.
his most important publication in this regard was his thoughts on the cause of the present discontents of 23 april 1770.
among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on lord bathurst (1684–1775); burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to bathurst the future greatness of england and also of america: "young man, there is america – which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world".
previously, paymasters had been able to draw on money from hm treasury at their discretion.
now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the treasury into the bank of england, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes.
in january 1790, burke read dr. richard price's sermon of 4 november 1789 entitled, a discourse on the love of our country, to the revolution society.
burke put forward that "we fear god, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility.
his use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism.
fellow whig mps richard sheridan and charles james fox, disagreed with burke and split with him.
there is something in the detested french constitution that envenoms every thing it touches".
burke wrote to henry dundas on 7 october urging him to send reinforcements there, as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on paris.
in november 1795, there was a debate in parliament on the high price of corn and burke wrote a memorandum to pitt on the subject.
this debate probably led burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the secretary of the board of agriculture, arthur young; but he failed to complete it.
writing to a friend in may 1795, burke surveyed the causes of discontent: "i think i can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of protestant ascendency, as they affect ireland; or of indianism [i.e. corporate tyranny, as practiced by the british east indies company], as they affect these countries, and as they affect asia; or of jacobinism, as they affect all europe, and the state of human society itself.
because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy.
as christopher hitchens summarises, "if modern conservatism can be held to derive from burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial."
mission work in samoa had begun in late 1830 by john williams, of the london missionary society arriving in sapapali'i from the cook islands and tahiti.
the samoan crisis came to a critical juncture in march 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent.
between 1919 and 1962, samoa was administered by the department of external affairs, a government department which had been specially created to oversee new zealand's island territories and samoa.
in accordance with the mau's non-violent philosophy, the newly elected leader, high chief tupua tamasese lealofi, led his fellow uniformed mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown apia on 28 december 1929.
chief tamasese was shot from behind and killed while trying to bring calm and order to the mau demonstrators, screaming "peace, samoa".
tupua tamasese mea'ole died in 1963, leaving malietoa tanumafili ii sole head of state until his death on 11 may 2007, upon which samoa changed from a constitutional monarchy to a parliamentary republic de facto.

pope paul vi (latin: paulus vi; italian: paolo vi), born giovanni battista enrico antonio maria montini (italian pronunciation: [dʒioˈvani baˈtista enˈriko anˈtonjo marˈija monˈtini]; 26 september 1897 – 6 august 1978), reigned as pope from 21 june 1963 to his death in 1978.
during the war years, thousands of letters from all parts of the world arrived at the desk of the pope, most of them asking for understanding, prayer and help.
his main advisor was monsignore giovanni colombo, whom he later appointed to be his successor in milan the commission was greatly overshadowed by the insistence of john xxiii to have the council complete all its work in one single session before christmas 1962, to the 400th anniversary of the council of trent, an insistence which may have also been influenced by the pope's recent knowledge that he had cancer.
although some cardinals seem to have viewed him as papabile, a likely candidate to become pope, and may have received some votes in the 1958 conclave, montini was not yet a cardinal, which made him an unlikely choice.[c] angelo roncalli was elected pope on 28 october 1958 and assumed the name john xxiii.
paul vi donated his own papal tiara, a gift from his former archdiocese of milan, to the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception in washington, dc (where it is on permanent display in the crypt) as a gift to american catholics.
during vatican ii, the council fathers avoided statements which might anger christians of other faiths.[page needed] cardinal augustin bea, the president of the christian unity secretariat, always had the full support of paul vi in his attempts to ensure that the council language was friendly and open to the sensitivities of protestant and orthodox churches, whom he had invited to all sessions at the request of pope john xxiii.

as the council discussed the role of bishops in the papacy, paul vi issued an explanatory note confirming the primacy of the papacy, a step which was viewed by some as meddling in the affairs of the council american bishops pushed for a speedy resolution on religious freedom, but paul vi insisted this to be approved together with related texts such as ecumenism.
the pope concluded the session on 21 november 1964, with the formal pronouncement of mary as mother of the church.
on 28 march, with pontificalis domus, and in several additional apostolic constitutions in the following years, he revamped the entire curia, which included reduction of bureaucracy, streamlining of existing congregations and a broader representation of non-italians in the curial positions.

further experimentation with the new mass by liturgists, such as the usage of pop/folk music (as opposed to the gregorian chant advocated by pope pius x), along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries, was viewed by some as vandalism.
to foster common bonds with all persons of good will, he decreed an annual peace day to be celebrated on january first of every year.
published by his order in january 1976 was a homily persona humana: declaration on certain questions concerning sexual ethics, which outlawed pre or extra-marital sex, condemned homosexuality, and forbade masturbation.
during the pope's visit, as the u.s. involvement in the vietnam war escalated under president johnson, paul vi pleaded for peace before the un:
the encyclical sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 june 1967, confirms the traditional church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for roman catholic priests.
however, during his pontificate paul vi was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by john paul ii in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 canon law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization.
to the pope as to all his predecessors, marital relations are much more than a union of two people.
paul vi was the first pope to receive an anglican archbishop of canterbury, michael ramsey in official audience as head of church, after the private audience visit of archbishop geoffrey fisher to pope john xxiii on 2 december 1960.
in 1965, paul vi decided on the creation of a joint working group with the world council of churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation.
some critiqued paul vi's decision; the newly created synod of bishops had an advisory role only and could not make decisions on their own, although the council decided exactly that.
paul vi systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the euro-centric church into a church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the synods which he convened.
this motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury.
his motor set a world record which was improved only four years later in september 1838 by jacobi himself.
in 1873, gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor, which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in vienna and philadelphia by connecting two such dc motors at a distance of up to 2 km away from each other, one as a generator. (
other sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by thomas edison), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided controls systems for electric operations.
industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure.
the motor's armature current is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole.
this creates friction.
this sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator.
the making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates rfi.
because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control.
to minimize overall weight and size, miniature pm motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy.
operating at normal power line frequencies, universal motors are often found in a range less than 1000 watts.
an advantage of the universal motor is that ac supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in dc motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used.
contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque.
one type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a dc field.
they start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized.
for instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping.
computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital servo-controlled system.
if the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply.
once these have been established by mathematical analysis using fea or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector.
continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or pm damage.
therefore, the swiss, although predominantly german-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnicity or language; rather, switzerland's strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and alpine symbolism.
due to its linguistic diversity, switzerland is known by a variety of native names: schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (german);[note 5] suisse [sɥis(ə)] (french); svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (italian); and svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ] or [ˈʒviːtsʁːɐ] (romansh).[note 6]
it has the highest nominal wealth (financial and non-financial assets) per adult in the world according to credit suisse and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product on the imf list.
the name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and after the swabian war of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire confederation.
the empire built another line of defense at the north border (the so-called donau-iller-rhine-limes), but at the end of the fourth century the increased germanic pressure forced the romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of german tribes.
the alemanni settled the swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the alps in the 8th century, forming alemannia.
by 1200, the swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of savoy, zähringer, habsburg, and kyburg.
when war broke out between france and its rivals, russian and austrian forces invaded switzerland.
the result was the act of mediation which largely restored swiss autonomy and introduced a confederation of 19 cantons.
giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the sonderbund kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the council of states, two representatives per canton) and a lower house (the national council, with representatives elected from across the country).
under general henri guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered.
the swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the alps known as the reduit.
concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through vichy france was severed in 1942, leaving switzerland completely surrounded by the axis.
over the course of the war, switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the international red cross, based in geneva, played an important part during the conflict.
switzerland was the last western republic to grant women the right to vote.
after obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven member federal council executive being elisabeth kopp, who served from 1984–1989, and the first female president being ruth dreifuss in 1999.
in the largest canton of graubünden, lying entirely in the alps, population density falls to 27 /km² (70 /sq mi).
the alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area.
the federal constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state.
direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the swiss political system.
similarly, the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months.[note 8] parliament can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted.
constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.[note 9]
apart from the united nations headquarters, the swiss confederation is host to many un agencies, like the world health organization (who), the international labour organization (ilo), the international telecommunication union (itu), the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) and about 200 other international organisations, including the world trade organization and the world intellectual property organization.
the reform "army xxi" was adopted by popular vote in 2003, it replaced the previous model "army 95", reducing the effectives from 400,000 to about 200,000.
the unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in june 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in december 2009.
according to credit suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in europe.
while the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defense; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).
there are 12 universities in switzerland, ten of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects.
there are 12 universities in switzerland, ten of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects.
the biggest university in switzerland is the university of zurich with nearly 25,000 students.
the swiss have also been under eu and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the eu.
on 25 may 2011 the swiss government announced that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. "
this gives a financial incentive to recycle as much as possible, since recycling is free.
most of these (64%) were from european union or efta countries.
switzerland has four official languages: principally german (63.5% total population share, with foreign residents, in 2013); french (22.5%) in the west; and italian (8.1%) in the south.
the weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are zürich, geneva–lausanne, basel and bern tend to increase.
immigration has brought islam (4.95%) and eastern orthodoxy (around 2%) as sizeable minority religions.
radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programs are produced in geneva, zürich and lugano.
switzerland hosted the 1954 fifa world cup, and was the joint host, with austria, of the euro 2008 tournament.
in june 2007 the swiss national council, one house of the federal assembly of switzerland, voted to overturn the ban, however the other house, the swiss council of states rejected the change and the ban remains in place.
some of mali's prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the african continent, and salt.
his efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974, in which famine killed thousands of people.
anti-government protests in 1991 led to a coup, a transitional government, and a new constitution.
peaceful student protests in january 1991 were brutally suppressed, with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants.
barricades as well as roadblocks were erected and traoré declared a state of emergency and imposed a nightly curfew.
mali underwent economic reform, beginning in 1988 by signing agreements with the world bank and the international monetary fund.
due to a backlash against the northern population after independence, mali is now in a situation where both groups complain about discrimination on the part of the other group.
malaria and other arthropod-borne diseases are prevalent in mali, as are a number of infectious diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis.
malian musical traditions are derived from the griots, who are known as "keepers of memories".
raleigh is an early example in the united states of a planned city, chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such.
during general sherman's carolinas campaign, raleigh was captured by union cavalry under the command of general hugh judson kilpatrick on april 13, 1865.
in 1880, the newspapers news and observer combined to form the news & observer.
this area is known as the "fall line" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers.
the term was coined by the greater raleigh chamber of commerce, developer john kane and planning director mitchell silver.
it is home to north carolina state university, meredith college, pullen park, pullen memorial baptist church, cameron village, lake johnson, the north carolina museum of art and historic saint mary's school.
these are located approximately 2 miles from rex hospital.
these are located approximately 2 miles from rex hospital.
primary neighborhoods include chastain, chavis heights, raleigh country club, southgate, kingwood forest, rochester heights, emerald village and biltmore hills.
the region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents.
raleigh's industrial base includes banking/financial services; electrical, medical, electronic and telecommunications equipment; clothing and apparel; food processing; paper products; and pharmaceuticals.
the duke energy center for the performing arts complex houses the raleigh memorial auditorium, the fletcher opera theater, the kennedy theatre, and the meymandi concert hall.
the national hockey league's carolina hurricanes franchise moved to raleigh in 1997 from hartford, connecticut (where it was known as the hartford whalers).
the airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year.
according to walter gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century bc.
in china, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or "wind" similar to what western europeans later called pneuma.
food was classified into "hot" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and "cold" (green vegetables) in china, india, malaya, and persia.
daniel and his friends were captured by the king of babylon during an invasion of israel.
daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days and were then compared to the king's men.
most of galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by benedictine monks at the school of salerno in regimen sanitatis salernitanum, which still had users in the 17th century.
jan baptist van helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment.
over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin b1, also known as thiamine.
in the early 20th century, carl von voit and max rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition.
in 1907, stephen m. babcock and edwin b. hart conducted the single-grain experiment, which took nearly four years to complete.
in 1913, elmer mccollum discovered the first vitamins, fat-soluble vitamin a, and water-soluble vitamin b (in 1915; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named vitamin c as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy.
as of 2014, nutrients are thought to be of two types: macro-nutrients which are needed in relatively large amounts, and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities.
some simple carbohydrates (e.g., fructose) follow different metabolic pathways (e.g., fructolysis) that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose, while, in essence, many complex carbohydrates may be digested at the same rate as simple carbohydrates.
this may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar.
fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved.
trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation.
trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the food processing industry, such as rancidity resistance.[citation needed]
most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so.
moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of dgla to aa is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation).
each protein molecule is composed of amino acids, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair).
excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine.
excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis.
the original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the food and nutrition board of the national research council read: "an ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food.
recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity.
some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources.
as with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as organic essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. (
phytochemicals (section below) and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known.
an international study in china found some regions had virtually no cancer or heart disease, while in other areas they reflected "up to a 100-fold increase" coincident with shifts from diets that were found to be entirely plant-based to heavily animal-based, respectively.
some studies show these to be, in high quantities, possible causes of some cancers.
the united healthcare/pacificare nutrition guideline recommends a whole plant food diet, and recommends using protein only as a condiment with meals.
animal tissue contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates (sugar, starch, and fiber), amino acids (in proteins), fatty acids (in lipids), and nucleic acids (dna and rna).
though some molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged, digestive processes release them from the matrix of foods.
the number of variables involved in such experiments is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of animal nutrition is still slowly evolving.
green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis.
the senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the usda is the agriculture, nutrition and forestry committee.
in many schools, a nutrition class will fall within the family and consumer science or health departments.
while a precise comparison between the naal and delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, zoellner et al.
for example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the my pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the usda.
among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.
in developing countries, malnutrition is more likely to be caused by poor access to a range of nutritious foods or inadequate knowledge.
because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, pollan argues, nutritionism can be blamed for many of the health problems relating to diet in the western world today.
the state of obesity clearly contributes to insulin resistance, which in turn can cause type 2 diabetes.
obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone leptin, and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another.
in the same time span that obesity doubled, diabetes numbers quadrupled in america.
the food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising).
the crimean war was a military conflict fought between october 1853 – march 1856 in which russia lost to an alliance of france, the united kingdom, the ottoman empire, and sardinia.
while the churches eventually worked out their differences and came to an initial agreement, both nicholas i of russia and napoleon iii refused to back down.
led by omar pasha, the ottomans fought a strong defensive battle and stopped the advance at silistra.
a separate action on the fort town of kars in eastern turkey led to a siege, and a turkish attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a russian fleet at sinop.
sevastopol fell after eleven months, and formerly neutral countries began to join the allied cause.
the disbandment of the centuries-old janissary corps by sultan mahmud ii on 15 june 1826 (auspicious incident) was a good deed for the country in the longer term, but it has deprived the country from its army forces for the nearest future.
ottoman forces were defeated in a number of battles, and egyptians were ready to capture constantinople, which forced the sultan mahmud ii to seek for russian military aid.
nicholas began courting britain by means of conversations with the british ambassador, george hamilton seymour, in january and february 1853.:105 nicholas insisted that he no longer wished to expand imperial russia:105 but that he had an obligation to the christian communities in the ottoman empire.:105  the tsar next dispatched a highly abrasive diplomat, prince menshikov, on a special mission to the ottoman sublime porte in february 1853.

now russia used the sultan's failure to resolve the issue of the protection of the christian sites in the holy land as a pretext for russian occupation of these danubian provinces.
the russians were reduced to scuttling their warships as blockships, after stripping them of their guns and men to reinforce batteries on shore.
during the siege, the russians lost four 110- or 120-gun, three-decker ships of the line, twelve 84-gun two-deckers and four 60-gun frigates in the black sea, plus a large number of smaller vessels.
failing to pursue the retreating forces was one of many strategic errors made during the war, and the russians themselves noted that had they pressed south that day they would have easily captured sevastopol.
when the local commanders failed to take advantage of the retreat, lord raglan sent out orders to move up.
cardigan formed up his unit and charged the length of the valley of the balaclava, under fire from russian batteries in the hills.

being outnumbered the russians abandoned poti and redut kale and drew back to marani.
the russians planned to hold the line of the ingur river which separates abkhazia from georgia proper.
the baltic was[when?]
in april 1854 an anglo-french fleet entered the baltic to attack the russian naval base of kronstadt and the russian fleet stationed there.
despite the shelling, the sailors of the 120-gun ship rossiya, led by captain viktor poplonsky, defended the entrance to the harbor.
perhaps the most influential contributor to the development of naval mining was a swede resident in russia, the inventor and civil engineer immanuel nobel (the father of alfred nobel).
camillo di cavour, under orders of victor emmanuel ii of piedmont-sardinia, sent an expeditionary corps of 15,000 soldiers, commanded by general alfonso la marmora, to side with french and british forces during the war.:111–12 this was an attempt at gaining the favour of the french, especially when the issue of uniting italy would become an important matter.

when russia attacked the ottoman empire in 1853, king otto of greece saw an opportunity to expand north and south into ottoman areas that had large greek christian majorities.
the veteran former foreign secretary lord palmerston became prime minister.
in conformity with article xi and xiii, the tsar and the sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on the black sea coast.
the principalities of moldavia and wallachia were nominally returned to the ottoman empire; in practice they became independent.
encouraged by the decision of the french, and supported by the german minister otto von bismarck, russia renounced the black sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856.
more recently, the historians andrew lambert and winfried baumgart have argued that, first, britain was following a geopolitical strategy in aiming to destroy a fledgling russian navy which might challenge the royal navy for control of the seas, and second that the war was a joint european response to a century of russian expansion not just southwards but also into western europe.
for example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).
npos have controlling members or a board of directors.
in some countries, where there is a token fee, in general it is used to meet legal requirements for establishing a contract between the executive and the organization.
charitable status is granted by the canada revenue agency (cra) upon application by a nonprofit; charities are allowed to issue income tax receipts to donors, must spend a certain percentage of their assets (including cash, investments and fixed assets) and file annual reports in order to maintain their charitable status.
traditionally, the npo has attracted mission-driven individuals who want to assist their chosen cause.
it has been mentioned that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments.
some npos which are particularly well known, often for the charitable or social nature of their activities performed during a long period of time, include amnesty international, oxfam, rotary international, kiwanis international, carnegie corporation of new york, nourishing usa, demira deutsche minenräumer (german mine clearers), fidh international federation for human rights, goodwill industries, united way, acorn (now defunct), habitat for humanity, teach for america, the red cross and red crescent organizations, unesco, ieee, incose, world wide fund for nature, heifer international, translators without borders and sos children's villages.

definitions of literature have varied over time; it is a "culturally relative definition".
drama is literature intended for performance.
lyric poetry (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in east asia where songs were collected by the chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the shijing or book of songs.
early genres included drama, fables, sutras and epic poetry.
william burroughs, in his early works, and hunter s. thompson expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the second world war, and post-modern critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general.
avicenna was born c. 980 in afšana, a village near bukhara (in present-day uzbekistan), the capital of the samanids, a persian dynasty in central asia and greater khorasan.
a number of theories have been proposed regarding avicenna's madhab (school of thought within islamic jurisprudence).
avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as introduction (isagoge)'s porphyry (philosopher), euclid's elements, ptolemy's almagest by an unpopular philosopher, abu abdullah nateli, who claimed philosophizing.
as a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the metaphysics of aristotle, which he could not understand until he read al-farabi's commentary on the work.
meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.
when ibn sina was 22 years old, he lost his father.
the pay was small, however, so ibn sina wandered from place to place through the districts of nishapur and merv to the borders of khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents.
ibn sina subsequently settled at rey, in the vicinity of modern tehran, the home town of rhazes; where majd addaula, a son of the last buwayhid emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (seyyedeh khatun).
ibn sina subsequently settled at rey, in the vicinity of modern tehran, the home town of rhazes; where majd addaula, a son of the last buwayhid emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (seyyedeh khatun).
following al-farabi's lead, avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (mahiat) and existence (wujud).
he did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.
sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal agent intellect.
avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality.
he used his transit observation to help establish that venus was, at least sometimes, below the sun in ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of venus comes before the sphere of the sun when moving out from the earth in the prevailing geocentric model.
liber aboali abincine de anima in arte alchemiae was the most influential, having influenced later medieval chemists and alchemists such as vincent of beauvais.
a monument was erected outside the bukhara museum[year needed].
in 1980, the soviet union, which then ruled his birthplace bukhara, celebrated the thousandth anniversary of avicenna's birth by circulating various commemorative stamps with artistic illustrations, and by erecting a bust of avicenna based on anthropological research by soviet scholars.[citation needed] near his birthplace in qishlak afshona, some 25 km (16 mi) north of bukhara, a training college for medical staff has been named for him.[year needed] on the grounds is a museum dedicated to his life, times and work.[citation needed]

the larger, al-shifa' (sanatio), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the bodleian library and elsewhere; part of it on the de anima appeared at pavia (1490) as the liber sextus naturalium, and the long account of ibn sina's philosophy given by muhammad al-shahrastani seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the al-shifa'.
a shorter form of the work is known as the an-najat (liberatio).
rather, a character almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a morpheme.
however, because these marks occur singly, without any implied context, and are made crudely and simply, qiu xigui concluded that "we do not have any basis for stating that these constituted writing nor is there reason to conclude that they were ancestral to shang dynasty chinese characters."
contrary to the popular belief of there being only one script per period, there were in fact multiple scripts in use during the han period.
this semi-cursive script was traditionally attributed to liu desheng c. 147–188 ad,[d] although such attributions refer to early masters of a script rather than to their actual inventors, since the scripts generally evolved into being over time.
after this point, although developments in the art of calligraphy and in character simplification still lay ahead, there were no more major stages of evolution for the mainstream script.
in addition, there are a number of dialect characters (方言字) that are not used in formal written chinese but represent colloquial terms in non-mandarin varieties of chinese.
furthermore, shanghainese and sichuanese also have their own series of written text, but these are not widely used in actual texts, mandarin being the preference for all mainland regions.
one of the most complex characters found in modern chinese dictionaries[g] is 齉 (u+9f49) (nàng,  listen (help·info), pictured below, middle image), meaning "snuffle" (that is, a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose), with "just" thirty-six strokes.
also in occasional modern use is 鱻 (xiān "fresh"; variant of 鮮 xiān) with 33 strokes.
some characters are also written with different stroke orders due to character simplification.
most typefaces in the song dynasty were regular script typefaces which resembled a particular person's handwriting (e.g. the handwriting of ouyang xun, yan zhenqing, or liu gongquan), while most modern regular script typefaces tend toward anonymity and regularity.
the cursive script (草書(书), cǎoshū, literally "grass script") is used informally.
the characters in the hong kong standard and the kangxi dictionary are also known as "traditional," but are not shown.
for example, the name for the hanja 水 is 물 수 (mul-su) in which 물 (mul) is the native korean pronunciation for "water", while 수 (su) is the sino-korean pronunciation of the character.
for example, the name for the hanja 水 is 물 수 (mul-su) in which 물 (mul) is the native korean pronunciation for "water", while 수 (su) is the sino-korean pronunciation of the character.
there is a clear trend toward the exclusive use of hangul in day-to-day south korean society.
hanja are still used to some extent, particularly in newspapers, weddings, place names and calligraphy (although it is nowhere near the extent of kanji use in day-to-day japanese society).
bermuda's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors.
however, it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island.
the top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the ice ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.
bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists.
the only indigenous mammals of bermuda are five species of bats, all of which are also found in the eastern united states: lasionycteris noctivagans, lasiurus borealis, lasiurus cinereus, lasiurus seminolus and perimyotis subflavus.
most of those historically described as "coloured" are today described as "black", or "of african heritage", which obscures their non-african heritage (those previously described as "coloured" who were not of african ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of south asians, particularly, is now growing.
the ancestry of bermuda's black population is distinguished from that of the british west indian black population in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of european and native american admixture; secondly, the source of the african ancestry.
very little of bermuda's original black emigration came from this area.
the best-known examples were the algonquian peoples who were exiled from the southern new england colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, notably in the aftermaths of the pequot and king philip's wars.
it is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the british empire.
local artwork may also be viewed at several galleries around the island.
combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs, the archipelago became known as the isle of devils.
in the first two centuries of settlement, it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable.[citation needed] before the american revolution more than ten thousand bermudians (over half of the total population through the years) gradually emigrated, primarily to the southern united states.
with seafaring the only real industry in the early decades, by the end of the 18th century, at least a third of the island's manpower was at sea at any one time.
the current us consul general is robert settje, who took office in august 2012.
the united states is bermuda's largest trading partner (providing over 71% of total imports, 85% of tourist visitors, and an estimated $163 billion of us capital in the bermuda insurance/re-insurance industry), and an estimated 5% of bermuda residents are us citizens, representing 14% of all foreign-born persons.
other nearby nations or territories, such as the united states, are not members (although the us commonwealth of puerto rico has observer status, and the united states virgin islands announced in 2007 they would seek ties with caricom).
from the 1950s onwards, bermuda relaxed its immigration laws, allowing increased immigration from britain and canada.
the plp, the party in government when the decision to join caricom was made, has been dominated for decades by west indians and their descendants. (
the late plp leader, dame lois browne-evans, and her trinidadian-born husband, john evans (who co-founded the west indian association of bermuda in 1976), were prominent members of this group.
for the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to privateering at every opportunity.
bermudian notes carry the image of queen elizabeth ii.
their most famous player is a 130 kilograms (290 lb) police officer named dwayne leverock.
bermuda has had one olympic medallist, clarence hill, who won a bronze medal in boxing.
nigeria is often referred to as the "giant of africa", owing to its large population and economy.
it overtook south africa to become africa's largest economy in 2014.
the word ( niger )  is an alteration of the tuareg name egerew n-igerewen used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around timbuktu prior to 19th-century european colonialism.
britain intervened in the lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly oba kosoko, helping to install the amenable oba akitoye, and signing the treaty between great britain and lagos on 1 january 1852.
on 1 january 1901, nigeria became a british protectorate, and part of the british empire, the foremost world power at the time.
nigeria's government was a coalition of conservative parties: the nigerian people's congress (npc), a party dominated by northerners and those of the islamic faith, and the igbo and christian-dominated national council of nigeria and the cameroons (ncnc) led by nnamdi azikiwe.
the opposition comprised the comparatively liberal action group (ag), which was largely dominated by the yoruba and led by obafemi awolowo.
babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the international monetary fund's structural adjustment program (sap) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt, which most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing.
free and fair elections were finally held on 12 june 1993, with a presidential victory for moshood kashimawo olawale abiola.
nigeria regained democracy in 1999 when it elected olusegun obasanjo, the former military head of state, as the new president of nigeria.
although the elections which brought obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.
jonathan of the pdp was declared the winner on 19 april 2011, having won the election with a total of 22,495,187 of the 39,469,484 votes cast, to stand ahead of muhammadu buhari from the main opposition party, the congress for progressive change (cpc), which won 12,214,853 of the total votes cast.
the area of southern nigeria between the niger and the cross rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, with it being replaced by grassland (see cross-niger transition forests).
on the african continent, egypt, equatorial guinea, chad, libya and south africa are important source countries of remittance flows to nigeria, while china is the biggest remittance-sending country in asia.
ogun is considered to be the current nigeria's industrial hub, as most factories are located in ogun and more companies are moving there, followed by lagos.
the satellite was launched from russia on 27 september 2003.
this satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in china.
it was launched on 13 may 2007, aboard a chinese long march 3b carrier rocket, from the xichang satellite launch centre in china.
on june 2012, president goodluck jonathan said that nigerians should limit their number of children.
an 18 december 2012 report on religion and public life by the pew research center stated that in 2010, 49.3 percent of nigeria's population was christian, 48.8 percent was muslim, and 1.9 percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated.
in terms of nigeria's major ethnic groups, the hausa ethnic group (predominant in the north) was found to be 95% muslim and 5% christian, the yoruba tribe (predominant in the west) was 55% muslim, 35% christian and 10% adherents of other religions, while the igbos (predominant in the east) and the ijaw (south) were 98% christian, with 2% practising traditional religions.

nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the bamako initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees.
as of 2014[update], life expectancy in nigeria is 52.62 years on average according to cia, and just over half the population have access to potable water and appropriate sanitation; as of 2010[update], the infant mortality is 8.4 deaths per 1000 live births.

they won the african cup of nations in 1980, 1994, and 2013, and have also hosted the u-17 & u-20 world cup.
nigeria's human rights record remains poor; according to the us department of state, the most significant human rights problems are: use of excessive force by security forces; impunity for abuses by security forces; arbitrary arrests; prolonged pretrial detention; judicial corruption and executive influence on the judiciary; rape, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees and suspects; harsh and life‑threatening prison and detention centre conditions; human trafficking for the purpose of prostitution and forced labour; societal violence and vigilante killings; child labour, child abuse and child sexual exploitation; female genital mutilation (fgm); domestic violence; discrimination based on sex, ethnicity, region and religion.
these fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 roman soldiers.
by that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished.
besides these churches the city housed st. paul's abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of st. nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the teutonic knights.
the fortified city temporarily fell to the french invasion in 1672 (the disaster year); where the french invasion was only stopped west of utrecht at the old hollandic waterline.
the halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of st martin church which collapsed; creating the current dom square between the tower and choir.
this led to the construction of the shopping mall hoog catharijne (nl), music centre vredenburg (hertzberger, 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway (catherijnebaan).
utrecht's cityscape is dominated by the dom tower, the tallest belfry in the netherlands and originally part of the cathedral of saint martin.
two other buildings were constructed around the nieuw galgenwaard stadium (2007).
surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out.
according to shanghai jiaotong university's university ranking in 2014 it is the 57th best university in the world.
of all other territories annexed by the ussr in 1939–40, the ones detached from finland (karelia, petsamo), estonia (ingrian area and petseri county) and latvia (abrene) remained part of the russian federation, the successor state of the soviet union, after 1991.
at the beginning of the 1930s, the nazi party's rise to power increased tensions between germany and the soviet union along with other countries with ethnic slavs, who were considered "untermenschen" (inferior) according to nazi racial ideology.
the soviet leadership believed that the west wanted to encourage german aggression in the east and that france and britain might stay neutral in a war initiated by germany, hoping that the warring states would wear each other out and put an end to both the soviet union and nazi germany.
the ensuing discussion of a potential political deal between germany and the soviet union had to be channeled into the framework of economic negotiations between the two countries, because close military and diplomatic connections, as was the case before the mid-1930s, had afterward been largely severed.
polish officials refused to allow soviet troops into polish territory if germany attacked; as polish foreign minister józef beck pointed out, they feared that once the red army entered their territories, it might never leave.
the tripartite military talks, started in mid-august, hit a sticking point regarding the passage of soviet troops through poland if germans attacked, and the parties waited as british and french officials overseas pressured polish officials to agree to such terms.
that same day, stalin received assurance that germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would place half of poland (border along the vistula river), latvia, estonia, finland, and bessarabia in the soviets' sphere of influence.
poland was to be partitioned in the event of its "political rearrangement"—the areas east of the pisa, narev, vistula and san rivers going to the soviet union while germany would occupy the west.
lithuania, adjacent to east prussia, would be in the german sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed to in september 1939 reassigned the majority of lithuania to the ussr.
eleven days after the soviet invasion of the polish kresy, the secret protocol of the molotov–ribbentrop pact was modified by the german–soviet treaty of friendship, cooperation and demarcation,) allotting germany a larger part of poland and transferring lithuania's territory (with the exception of left bank of river scheschupe, the "lithuanian strip") from the envisioned german sphere to the soviets.
finland ceded southeastern areas of karelia (10% of finnish territory), which resulted in approximately 422,000 karelians (12% of finland's population) losing their homes.
although the french communists had unanimously voted in parliament for war credits on 2 september and on 19 september declared their "unshakeable will" to defend the country, on 27 september the comintern formally instructed the party to condemn the war as imperialist.
the soviets also helped germany to avoid british naval blockades by providing a submarine base, basis nord, in the northern soviet union near murmansk.
on june 16, as the soviets invaded lithuania, but before they had invaded latvia and estonia, ribbentrop instructed his staff "to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the baltic states a tendency to seek support from the reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc."
within six months, the soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties, and germany had captured three million soviet prisoners.
both documents were discovered as part of the microfilmed records in august 1945 by the state department employee wendell b. blancke, head of a special unit called "exploitation german archives" (ega).
in november 1947, president truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the foreign ministers conference in london scheduled for december.
state department officials counted it as a success: "the soviet government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war."
"[page needed] according to carr, the "bastion" created by means of the pact, "was and could only be, a line of defense against potential german attack.
some critics of stalin's policy, such as the popular writer viktor suvorov, claim that stalin's primary motive for signing the soviet–german non-aggression treaty was his calculation that such a pact could result in a conflict between the capitalist countries of western europe.[citation needed] this idea is supported by albert l. weeks.[page needed] claims by suvorov that stalin planned to invade germany in 1941 are debated by historians with, for example, david glantz opposing such claims, while mikhail meltyukhov supports them.[citation needed] the authors of the black book of communism consider the pact a crime against peace and a "conspiracy to conduct war of aggression."
when there is a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge +q to collect on one plate and negative charge −q to collect on the other plate.
when there is a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge +q to collect on one plate and negative charge −q to collect on the other plate.
if a battery has been attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time, no current can flow through the capacitor.
benjamin franklin investigated the leyden jar and came to the conclusion that the charge was stored on the glass, not in the water as others had assumed.
solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors were invented by bell laboratories in the early 1950s as a miniaturized and more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor.
last but not least the electric double-layer capacitor (now supercapacitors) were invented.
the non-conductive region is called the dielectric.
thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage, as discussed above.
as with any antiderivative, a constant of integration is added to represent the initial voltage v(t0).
the simplest model capacitor consists of two thin parallel conductive plates separated by a dielectric with permittivity ε .
the plates are considered to extend uniformly over an area a and a charge density ±ρ = ±q/a exists on their surface.
for air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 mv/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 mv/m; for oil, 15 to 25 mv/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric.
electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer.
supercapacitors made from carbon aerogel, carbon nanotubes, or highly porous electrode materials, offer extremely high capacitance (up to 5 kf as of 2010[update]) and can be used in some applications instead of rechargeable batteries.
as an example of the origin of this mechanism, the internal microscopic dipoles contributing to the dielectric constant cannot move instantly, and so as frequency of an applied alternating voltage increases, the dipole response is limited and the dielectric constant diminishes.
a changing dielectric constant with frequency is referred to as dielectric dispersion, and is governed by dielectric relaxation processes, such as debye relaxation.
measurement "without the dielectric" in principle means measurement in free space, an unattainable goal inasmuch as even the quantum vacuum is predicted to exhibit nonideal behavior, such as dichroism.
for practical purposes, when measurement errors are taken into account, often a measurement in terrestrial vacuum, or simply a calculation of c0, is sufficiently accurate.)
they are used in phase-locked loops, amongst other applications.
service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using a brinkley stick.
capacitors used in rf or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls.
proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.
from the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented in a progressive narrative in which true theories replaced false beliefs.

although no tremors could be felt in the capital when zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400 km (248 mi) to 500 km (310 mi) northwest of luoyang (in what is now modern gansu).
in the middle east, greek philosophy was able to find some support under the newly created arab empire.
the use of a single language, arabic, allowed communication without need of a translator.

precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the islamic world, can be seen already in grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by bacon, particularly in his opus majus.
this was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by johannes kepler in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow elliptical orbits, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse.
in 1925, werner heisenberg and erwin schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics, which explained the preceding quantum theories.

theophrastus' work on rocks, peri lithōn, remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the scientific revolution.
roger boesche describes the arthaśāstra as "a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good."
during the middle ages, the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts.
in the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.

the sociology of science in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they "produce" and "construct" scientific knowledge.
in many incarnations, digimon are raised by humans called "digidestined" or "tamers", and they team up to defeat evil digimon and human villains who are trying to destroy the fabric of the digital world.
digimon was first conceived as a virtual pet toy in the vein of tamagotchis and, as such, took influence from tamagotchis' cute and round designs.
as such, many of the early digimon—including tyrannomon, the first one ever created—were based on dinosaurs.
they age via a process called "digivolution" which changes their appearance and increases their powers.
the data then recomposes itself as a digi-egg, which will hatch when rubbed gently, and the digimon goes through its life cycle again.
however, if a digimon's data is completely destroyed, they will die.
however, a new evil has appeared in the form of the digimon emperor (digimon kaiser) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the digidestined.
on august 17, 2011, shueisha's v-jump magazine announced a sequel set one year later, a third arc of xros wars subtitled the young hunters who leapt through time, which aired from october 2, 2011 to march 25, 2012, following on from the previous arc.
continental glaciers cover nearly 13,000,000 km2 (5×10^6 sq mi) or about 98 percent of antarctica's 13,200,000 km2 (5.1×10^6 sq mi), with an average thickness of 2,100 m (7,000 ft).
only nunataks protrude from their surfaces.
most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which often results in a tremendous impact as the iceberg strikes the water.
glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.
in other cases, glaciers can move as fast as 20–30 m (70–100 ft) per day, such as in greenland's jakobshavn isbræ (greenlandic: sermeq kujalleq).
glaciers are present on every continent and approximately fifty countries, excluding those (australia, south africa) that have glaciers only on distant subantarctic island territories.
glaciers are present on every continent and approximately fifty countries, excluding those (australia, south africa) that have glaciers only on distant subantarctic island territories.
areas of the arctic, such as banks island, and the mcmurdo dry valleys in antarctica are considered polar deserts where glaciers cannot form because they receive little snowfall despite the bitter cold.
before glaciation, mountain valleys have a characteristic "v" shape, produced by eroding water.
they range in length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long.
comcast is sometimes described as a family business.
brian l. roberts, chairman, president, and ceo of comcast, is son of co-founder ralph roberts.
a dispute in 2004 with cwa, a labor union that represented many employees at comcast's offices in beaverton, oregon, led to allegations of management intimidating workers, requiring them to attend anti-union meetings and unwarranted disciplinary action for union members.
comcast reported first quarter 2012 profit increases of 30% due to increase in high-speed internet customers.
in 1963, ralph j. roberts in conjunction with his two business partners, daniel aaron and julian a. brodsky, purchased american cable systems as a corporate spin-off from its parent, jerrold electronics, for us $500,000.

comcast announced in may 2007 and launched in september 2008 a dashboard called smartzone.
media outlets began reporting in late september 2009 that comcast was in talks to buy nbcuniversal.
ge would maintain 49% control of the new company, while comcast owned 51%.
on february 12, 2014, the los angeles times reported that comcast sought to acquire time warner cable in a deal valued at $45.2 billion.

more than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries.
these are collectively denoted as "extrapulmonary tuberculosis".
extrapulmonary tb occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children.

a diagnosis of tb should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.
interferon gamma release assays (igras), on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the mantoux test.
the world health organization declared tb a "global health emergency" in 1993, and in 2006, the stop tb partnership developed a global plan to stop tuberculosis that aims to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015.
a number of targets they have set are not likely to be achieved by 2015, mostly due to the increase in hiv-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis.
the chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% as of 2008, down from 8% in 1995.
of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35 million occur in those also infected with hiv.
in 2007, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of tb was swaziland, with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people.
the bacillus causing tuberculosis, m. tuberculosis, was identified and described on 24 march 1882 by robert koch.
koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a "remedy" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it "tuberculin".
a number of medications are being studied for multi drug resistant tuberculosis including: bedaquiline and delamanid.
during this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions.
ickes prohibited discrimination in hiring for public works administration funded projects and oversaw not only the institution of a quota system, where contractors were required to employ a fixed percentage of black workers, by robert c. weaver and clark foreman,:12 but also the equal pay of women proposed by harry hopkins.:14fdr's largest contribution to affirmative action, however, lay in his executive order 8802 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry or government.:22 the executive order promoted the idea that if taxpayer funds were accepted through a government contract, then all taxpayers should have an equal opportunity to work through the contractor.:23–4 to enforce this idea, roosevelt created the fair employment practices committee (fepc) with the power to investigate hiring practices by government contractors.:22
to secure these rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by lyndon b. johnson.:35–36
lockheed signed an agreement with vice president johnson that pledged an "aggressive seeking out for more qualified minority candidates for technical and skill positions.:63–64 this agreement was the administration's model for a "plan of progress."

it also worked with jfk's executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate.
doing so, he convinced many pro-business republicans, including senate minority leader everett dirksen (il) to support title vii.:78–80
president kennedy stated in executive order 10925 that "discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin is contrary to the constitutional principles and policies of the united states"; that "it is the plain and positive obligation of the united states government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons, without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin, employed or seeking employment with the federal government and on government contracts"; that "it is the policy of the executive branch of the government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the government"; and that "it is in the general interest and welfare of the united states to promote its economy, security, and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower".

by valuing diversity, employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population.
according to a study by geoffrey maruyama and josé f. moreno, the results showed that faculty members believed diversity helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education, caucasian students suffer no detrimental effects from classroom diversity, and that attention to multicultural learning improves the ability of colleges and universities to accomplish their missions.
sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147
during a panel discussion at harvard university's reunion for african american alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—lani guinier and henry louis gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at harvard.
in 2006, jian li, a chinese undergraduate at yale university, filed a civil rights complaint with the office for civil rights against princeton university, claiming that his race played a role in their decision to reject his application for admission and seeking the suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it "discontinues discrimination against asian americans in all forms" by eliminating race and legacy preferences.
li countered in an email, saying that his placement on the waitlist undermines rapelye's claim. "

the first six rounds are the qualifying competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the competition proper, meeting the first of the 92 professional teams.
winners receive the fa cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911.
in 1863, the newly founded football association (the fa) published the laws of the game of association football, unifying the various different rules in use before then.
on 20 july 1871, in the offices of the sportsman newspaper, the fa secretary c. w. alcock proposed to the fa committee that "it is desirable that a challenge cup should be established in connection with the association for which all clubs belonging to the association should be invited to compete".
the 1922–23 competition saw the first final to be played in the newly opened wembley stadium (known at the time as the empire stadium).
the number of entrants has increased greatly in recent years.
the final is normally held the saturday after the premier league season finishes in may. the only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were 1999–2000, when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment, and 2010–11 and 2012–13 when the fa cup final was played before the premier league season had finished, to allow wembley stadium to be ready for the uefa champions league final, as well as in 2011–12 to allow england time to prepare for that summer's european championships.
this led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced, the first of which came on 26 november 1991 when rotherham united eliminated scunthorpe united.
the original wembley stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring london teams.
in 2003 the fa took the decision to permanently use the new wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.
the rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the millennium stadium in cardiff in wales.
in the 51 years prior to the empire stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in london, and mainly at the kennington oval and then crystal palace.
there have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been presented.
almost 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal henry (harry) james burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the sunday pictorial newspaper on 23 february 1958.
the successful bidder was david gold, the then joint chairman of birmingham city; claiming the fa and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation.
however, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'the fa cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the league cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name.
sponsorship deals run for four years, though – as in the case of e.on – one-year extensions may be agreed.
the possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition, known as "giant killings", is much anticipated by the public, and is considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, alongside that gained by teams winning the competition.
the first fa cup final on radio was in 1926 between bolton wanderers and manchester city but this was only broadcast in manchester, the first national final on bbc radio was between arsenal and cardiff in 1927.

alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of lorraine and the former duchy of lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because german possession as the imperial province (alsace-lorraine, 1871–1918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; france and germany exchanged control of parts of lorraine (including alsace) four times in 75 years.
cities such as colmar and hagenau also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the "decapole" or "dekapolis", a federation of ten free towns.
as in much of europe, the prosperity of alsace came to an end in the 14th century by a series of harsh winters, bad harvests, and the black death.
france began an aggressive policy of expanding eastward, first to the rivers rhône and meuse, and when those borders were reached, aiming for the rhine.
in 1469, following the treaty of st. omer, upper alsace was sold by archduke sigismund of austria to charles the bold, duke of burgundy.
official tolerance grew during the french revolution, with full emancipation in 1791.

the strumica carnival (macedonian: струмички карневал, translated strumichki karneval) has been held since at least 1670, when the turkish author evlija chelebija wrote while staying there, "i came into a town located in the foothills of a high hillock and what i saw that night was masked people running house–to–house, with laughter, scream and song."
the strumica carnival opens on a saturday night at a masked ball where the prince and princess are chosen; the main carnival night is on tuesday, when masked participants (including groups from abroad) compete in various subjects.

men attend the balls, but they pay admittance and are not disguised.
the persecution of religious nonconformists in england led smyth to go into exile in amsterdam with fellow separatists from the congregation he had gathered in lincolnshire, separate from the established church (anglican).
according to this view, the general baptists shared similarities with dutch waterlander mennonites (one of many anabaptist groups) including believer's baptism only, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin.
in 1639, williams established a baptist church in providence, rhode island, and clarke began a baptist church in newport, rhode island.
the first official record of a baptist church in canada was that of the horton baptist church (now wolfville) in wolfville, nova scotia on 29 october 1778.
leading up to the american civil war, baptists became embroiled in the controversy over slavery in the united states.
as tensions increased, in 1844 the home mission society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by georgia.
in jamaica, for example, william knibb, a prominent british baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the british west indies (which took place in 1838).
on 20 june 1995, the southern baptist convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery.
some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in london in the mid-18th century).
this act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days.
since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break.
this included children who rolled cigarettes, engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin doffers in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries.
factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century.
children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents.
some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants.
in total, there is an estimated five million children who are currently working in the field of agriculture which steadily increases during the time of harvest.
along with 30 percent of children who are picking coffee, there are an estimated 25,000 school age children who work year round.
another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business.
due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family.
in 1966, the nation adopted the un general assembly of the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights.
the british thus became masters of east india (bengal, bihar, orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade.

in late 2000 a bbc documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of cocoa—the main ingredient in chocolate— in west africa.
this agreement created a foundation named international cocoa initiative in 2002.
bbc, in 2012, accused glencore of using child labour in its mining and smelting operations of africa.
glencore denied it used child labour, and said it has strict policy of not using child labour.
bbc subsequently apologised for faking footage, and returned the television award for investigative reporting.
however, others have raised concerns that boycotting products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture.

the heian period (平安時代, heian jidai?)
means "peace" in japanese.
by 801 the shogun had defeated the emishi and had extended the imperial domains to the eastern end of honshū.
for a time, however, during the reign of emperor daigo (897-930), the fujiwara regency was suspended as he ruled directly.
central control of japan had continued to decline, and the fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century.
as the most powerful family, the fujiwara governed japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne.
shōen holders had access to manpower and, as they obtained improved military technology (such as new training methods, more powerful bows, armor, horses, and superior swords) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century, military service became part of shōen life.
these military families gained prestige from connections to the imperial court and court-granted military titles and access to manpower.
the fujiwara family, taira clan, and minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.
the period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the in-no-cho and of the rise of the military class throughout the country.
the major buddhist temples in heian-kyō and nara also made use of the shōen.

the three fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to tierra del fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to darwin their relatives on the island seemed "miserable, degraded savages", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.
in late september 1838, he started reading thomas malthus's an essay on the principle of population with its statistical argument that human populations, if unrestrained, breed beyond their means and struggle to survive.
in november 1844, the anonymously published popular science book vestiges of the natural history of creation, written by scottish journalist robert chambers, widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species.
vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time.
here the term "races" is used as an alternative for "varieties" and does not carry the modern connotation of human races—the first use in the book refers to "the several races, for instance, of the cabbage" and proceeds to a discussion of "the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants".
his estimate that writing his "big book" would take five years was optimistic.
in a may letter, darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this referred to the first printing only as there were four that year.
in the second edition, darwin added an epigraph from joseph butler affirming that god could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles, in a nod to the religious concerns of his oldest friends.
in the second edition, darwin added an epigraph from joseph butler affirming that god could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles, in a nod to the religious concerns of his oldest friends.
he concludes that "a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species" and that "species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties".
darwin and wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.
more detail was given in darwin's 1868 book on the variation of animals and plants under domestication, which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis.
darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food.
therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.
evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist thomas henry huxley.
huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the april 1860 westminster review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising darwin for "extending the domination of science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated" and coining the term "darwinism" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science.
others, including charles lyell and alfred russel wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.
ernst haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise darwin's ideas with those of lamarck and goethe while still reflecting the spirit of naturphilosophie.
there were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including karl von nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection.
baden powell praised "mr darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".
in america, asa gray argued that evolution is the secondary effect, or modus operandi, of the first cause, design, and published a pamphlet defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, natural selection is not inconsistent with natural theology.
it makes sense of the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture.
the text of origin itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959, and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981.

on july 1, 1988, the fourth and last day of a bruising 19th party conference, gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last-minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the congress of people's deputies.
detailed proposals for the new congress of people's deputies were published on october 2, 1988, and to enable the creation of the new legislature the supreme soviet, during its november 29–december 1, 1988, session, implemented amendments to the 1977 soviet constitution, enacted a law on electoral reform, and set the date of the election for march 26, 1989.

christopher m. tuckett states that, although the exact reasons for the death of jesus are hard to determine, one of the indisputable facts about him is that he was crucified.
in the synoptic gospels, jesus predicts his death in three separate episodes.
combining statements in the canonical gospels produces the following account: jesus was arrested in gethsemane following the last supper with the twelve apostles, and then stood trial before the sanhedrin (a jewish judicial body), pontius pilate (a roman authority in judaea), and herod antipas (king of judea, appointed by rome), before being handed over for crucifixion by the chief priests of the jews.
following jesus' death, his body was removed from the cross by joseph of arimathea and buried in a rock-hewn tomb, with nicodemus assisting.
for instance, only matthew's gospel mentions an earthquake, resurrected saints who went to the city and that roman soldiers were assigned to guard the tomb, while mark is the only one to state the actual time of the crucifixion (the third hour, or 9 am) and the centurion's report of jesus' death.
john is also the only one to refer to the request that the legs be broken and the soldier's subsequent piercing of jesus' side (as fulfillment of old testament prophecy), as well as that nicodemus assisted joseph with burial.
some have argued that jesus was crucified on wednesday, not friday, on the grounds of the mention of "three days and three nights" in matthew before his resurrection, celebrated on sunday.
scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue, some suggesting a reconciliation, e.g., based on the use of roman timekeeping in john but not in mark, yet others have rejected the arguments.
a third is that the name was derived from the physical contour, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of "a skull".
apart from these women, the three synoptic gospels speak of the presence of others: "the chief priests, with the scribes and elders"; two robbers crucified, one on jesus' right and one on his left, whom the gospel of luke presents as the penitent thief and the impenitent thief; "the soldiers", "the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over jesus"; passers-by; "bystanders", "the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle"; and "his acquaintances"
the tradition also carries to christian emblems, e.g. the jesuits use three nails under the ihs monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.
he describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'.
christian traveller and historian sextus julius africanus and christian theologian origen refer to greek historian phlegon, who lived in the 2nd century ad, as having written "with regard to the eclipse in the time of tiberius caesar, in whose reign jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place"
modern biblical scholarship treats the account in the synoptic gospels as a literary creation by the author of the mark gospel, amended in the luke and matthew accounts, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event, and not intended to be taken literally.
in these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant.
john calvin supported the "agent of god" christology and argued that in his trial in pilate's court jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the father.
in the eastern church sergei bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of jesus was "pre-eternally" determined by the father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of adam.
in the eastern church sergei bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of jesus was "pre-eternally" determined by the father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of adam.
according to the substitutionary atonement view, jesus' death is of central importance, and jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased god.
both views are popular within the roman catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.
19:26-27] has in itself been the subject of marian art, and well known catholic symbolism such as the miraculous medal and pope john paul ii's coat of arms bearing a marian cross.
in civil law jurisdictions the doctrine of stare decisis is not generally considered to apply, so the decisions of the supreme court are not necessarily binding beyond the immediate case before it; however, in practice the decisions of the supreme court usually provide a very strong precedent, or jurisprudence constante, for both itself and all lower courts.
in canada, the supreme court of canada was established in 1875 but only became the highest court in the country in 1949 when the right of appeal to the judicial committee of the privy council was abolished.
the supreme court is also vested with the power of judicial review to ensure the application of the rule of law.
in brazil, the supreme federal tribunal (supremo tribunal federal) is the highest court.
it also judges, in original jurisdiction, cases involving members of congress, senators, ministers of state, members of the high courts and the president and vice-president of the republic.
while the philippines is generally considered a civil law nation, its supreme court is heavily modelled after the american supreme court.
the court sits either en banc or in divisions, depending on the nature of the case to be decided.
only those cases related to human rights can be appealed at the constitutional court (which also decides about acts accordance with spanish constitution).
in sri lanka, the supreme court of sri lanka was created in 1972 after the adoption of a new constitution.
in the people's republic of china, the final power to interpret the law is vested in the standing committee of the national people's congress (npcsc).
this power includes the power to interpret the basic laws of hong kong and macau, the constitutional documents of the two special administrative regions which are common law and portuguese-based legal system jurisdictions respectively.
interest in applying textual criticism to the qur'an has also developed after the discovery of the sana'a manuscripts in 1972, which possibly date back to the 7–8th centuries.
while christianity has been relatively receptive to textual criticism, application of it to the jewish (masoretic) torah and the qur'an is, to the devout, taboo.[citation needed]
at the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.
the collation of all known variants of a text is referred to as a variorum, namely a work of textual criticism whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication.
that is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a hyparchetype.
if it seems that one manuscript is by far the best text, then copy text editing is appropriate, and if it seems that a group of manuscripts are good, then eclecticism on that group would be proper.
he also noted that, for many works, more than one reasonable stemma could be postulated, suggesting that the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed.
there were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of bowers's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of maggie.
by 1979, with the establishment of the foundation for ancient research and mormon studies (farms) as a california non-profit research institution, an effort led by robert f. smith began to take full account of larson’s work and to publish a critical text of the book of mormon.
thus was born the farms critical text project which published the first volume of the 3-volume book of mormon critical text in 1984.
in 1988, with that preliminary phase of the project completed, professor skousen took over as editor and head of the farms critical text of the book of mormon project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the original manuscript of the book of mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.
all things being equal, textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.
a singer practically had to put his or her face in the recording horn.
contrary to popular belief, if placed properly and prepared-for, drums could be effectively used and heard on even the earliest jazz and military band recordings.
vaudeville stars gallagher and shean recorded "mr. gallagher and mr. shean", written by irving and jack kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for cameo.
by about 1910,[note 1] bound collections of empty sleeves with a paperboard or leather cover, similar to a photograph album, were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records (the term "record album" was printed on some covers).
for collectable or nostalgia purposes, or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups, a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production.
this failure to warn customers gave the rhino 78 records a bad reputation,[citation needed] as they were destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players but played very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles.
in the mid-1940s, special dj copies of records started being made of vinyl also, for the same reason.
in the late 1930s, radio commercials and pre-recorded radio programs being sent to disc jockeys started being stamped in vinyl, so they would not break in the mail.
it took about eight years of study, except when it was suspended because of world war ii.
unwilling to accept and license columbia's system, in february 1949 rca victor, in cooperation of its parent, the radio corporation of america, released the first 45 rpm single, 7 inches in diameter with a large center hole.
early 45 rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene.
this action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the clv version of its predecessor, the philips laser disc.
after world war ii these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats.
subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.
eventually the 12-inch (300 mm) 33 1⁄3 rpm lp prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums, and 10-inch lps were no longer issued.
the mercury living presence recordings were remastered to cd in the 1990s by the original producer, wilma cozart fine, using the same method of 3-to-2 mix directly to the master recorder.
it also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk.
these were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers, relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range (dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed by a factor of two in db: quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain, via automatic gain control in the playback equipment; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages).
the sound is encoded by fine variations in the edges of the groove that cause a stylus (needle) placed in it to vibrate at acoustic frequencies when the disc is rotated at the correct speed.
towards the center, at the end of the groove, there is another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out.
at the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record.
many longer sound recordings, such as complete operas, were interleaved across several 10-inch or 12-inch discs for use with auto-changing mechanisms, so that the first disk of a three-disk recording would carry sides 1 and 6 of the program, while the second disk would carry sides 2 and 5, and the third, sides 3 and 4, allowing sides 1, 2, and 3 to be played automatically; then the whole stack reversed to play sides 4, 5, and 6.
when auto-changing turntables were commonplace, records were typically pressed with a raised (or ridged) outer edge and a raised label area, allowing records to be stacked onto each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact, reducing the risk of damage.
in extreme cases, they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backwards, creating a "locked groove" that repeats over and over.
subsonic frequencies below about 20 hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100 hz.
g. h. miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form.
as a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre-emphasis above 1,000 hz in 78 rpm and 33 1⁄3 rpm records.
evidence from the early technical literature concerning electrical recording suggests that it wasn't until the 1942–1949 period that there were serious efforts to standardize recording characteristics within an industry.
the nab, among other items, issued recording standards in 1949 for laterally and vertically cut records, principally transcriptions.
he traced rca victor characteristics back to the western electric "rubber line" recorder in 1925 up to the early 1950s laying claim to long-held recording practices and reasons for major changes in the intervening years.
toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.
the victor orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected.
eventually, when it was more common for electric recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era.
in the early 1930s bell telephone laboratories and western electric announced the total reinvention of disc recording: the western electric wide range system, "the new voice of action".
the lp record for longer works, 45 rpm for pop music, and fm radio became high fidelity program sources in demand.
the lp record for longer works, 45 rpm for pop music, and fm radio became high fidelity program sources in demand.
there is a theory that vinyl records can audibly represent higher frequencies than compact discs.
the medium needs to be kept clean, but alcohol should only be used on pvc or optical media, not on 78s.[citation needed] the equipment for playback of certain formats (e.g., 16 and 78 rpm) is manufactured only in small quantities, leading to increased difficulty in finding equipment to play the recordings.
for example, nimbus records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s.
vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles.
the sales record was previously held by pearl jam's, vitalogy, which sold 34,000 copies in one week in 1994.
concerns over turner entertainment's corporate debt load resulted in turner selling the studio that october back to kirk kerkorian, from whom turner had purchased the studio less than a year before.
as part of the deal, turner entertainment retained ownership of mgm's library of films released up to may 9, 1986.
after the library was acquired, mgm/ua signed a deal with turner to continue distributing the pre-may 1986 mgm and to begin distributing the pre-1950 warner bros. film libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to turner home entertainment).
tcm's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the motion picture association of america's ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the motion picture production code.
the network's programming season runs from february until the following march of each year when a retrospective of oscar-winning and oscar-nominated movies is shown, called 31 days of oscar.
turner classic movies presents many of its features in their original aspect ratio (widescreen or full screen) whenever possible – widescreen films broadcast on tcm are letterboxed on the network's standard definition feed.
tcm's library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles.
columbia's film output is owned by sony (through sony pictures television); distribution of 20th century fox's film library is handled for television by its 21st century fox subsidiary 20th television, and the walt disney studios (owned by the walt disney company) has its library film output handled for television by disney-abc domestic television.
most feature movies shown during the prime time and early overnight hours (8:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. eastern time) are presented by film historian robert osborne (who has been with the network since its 1994 launch, except for a five-month medical leave from july to december 2011, when guest hosts presented each night's films) on sunday through wednesday evenings – with osborne only presenting primetime films on weekends – and ben mankiewicz presenting only late evening films on thursdays, and the "silent sunday nights" and "tcm imports" blocks on sundays.

"funday night at the movies" was replaced in 2008 by "essentials jr.", a youth-oriented version of its weekly series the essentials (originally hosted by actors abigail breslin and chris o'donnell, then by john lithgow from 2009 to 2011, and then by bill hader starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as national velvet, captains courageous and yours, mine and ours, as well as more eclectic selections as sherlock, jr., the music box, harvey, mutiny on the bounty and the man who knew too much.
the network aired the film series screened out (which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film) in 2007 and religion on film (focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works) in 2005.
since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by indie artists such as badly drawn boy (2007) or steve earle (2009).
the initial batch of dvds are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (mod).
in canada, tcm began to be carried on shaw cable and satellite provider shaw direct in 2005.
these are also called the astika (orthodox) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the vedas as authoritative, important source of knowledge.[note 1][note 2] ancient and medieval india was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the vedas, and these have been called nāstika (heterodox or non-orthodox) indian philosophies.
while buddhism and jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox traditions such as cārvāka are often considered as distinct schools within hindu philosophy.

ancient and medieval hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts) each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by each school .
it regards the universe as consisting of two realities; puruṣa (consciousness) and prakriti (matter).

classical samkhya is considered an atheist / non-theistic hindu philosophy.
in indian philosophy, yoga is among other things, the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools.
it postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to paramāṇu (atoms), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence.
knowledge and liberation was achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to vaiśeṣika school .
vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that the reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, fire).
a composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms.
whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible.
moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge.
the epistemology of the vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).
the empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore "transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be".
according to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: brahman, soul, and matter.
pāśupata shaivism (pāśupata, "of paśupati") is the oldest of the major shaiva schools.
the philosophy of pashupata sect was systematized by lakulish in the 2nd century ce.
salvation in pāśupata involved the union of the soul with god through the intellect.
the first political factions, cohering around a basic, if fluid, set of principles emerged from the exclusion crisis and glorious revolution in late-17th-century england.
at times they cooperated with the "opposition whigs", whigs who were in opposition to the whig government; however, the ideological gap between the tories and the opposition whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party.
although the founding fathers of the united states did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan, early political controversies in the 1790s over the extent of federal government powers saw the emergence of two proto-political parties- the federalist party and the democratic-republican party, which were championed by framers alexander hamilton and james madison, respectively.
in 1882, he changed his party's name to the irish parliamentary party and created a well-organized grass roots structure, introducing membership to replace "ad hoc" informal groupings.
a political party is typically led by a party leader (the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party), a party secretary (who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings), party treasurer (who is responsible for membership dues) and party chair (who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members, and also chairs party meetings).

regulation of parties may run from a crackdown on or repression of all opposition parties, a norm for authoritarian governments, to the repression of certain parties which hold or promote ideals which run counter to the general ideology of the state's incumbents (or possess membership by-laws which are legally unenforceable).
washington also warned against political parties during his farewell address.
in one-party systems, one political party is legally allowed to hold effective power.
sometimes, political, social and economic circumstances, and public opinion are the reason for others parties' failure.
french political scientist maurice duverger drew a distinction between cadre parties and mass parties.
cadre parties were political elites that were concerned with contesting elections and restricted the influence of outsiders, who were only required to assist in election campaigns.

similarly, when jewish families and larger groups sing traditional sabbath songs known as zemirot outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and bar and bat mitzvah celebrations on the sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles.
the popularization of the jewish chant may be found in the writings of the jewish philosopher philo, born 20 bce.
the shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service.
in july 1943, as a result of the american federation of musicians boycott of us recording studios, the a cappella vocal group the song spinners had a best-seller with "comin' in on a wing and a prayer".
there also remains a strong a cappella presence within christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship.
in transit incorporates vocal beat boxing into its contemporary a cappella arrangements through the use of a subway beat boxer character.
co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including john legend, an alumnus of the counterparts at the university of pennsylvania, and sara bareilles, an alumna of awaken a cappella at university of california, los angeles.
another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for the new addams family series on fox family channel (now abc family).
beatboxing, more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the hip-hop community, where rap is often performed a cappella also.
like the other groups, examples of their music can be found on youtube.
the order is famed for its intellectual tradition, having produced many leading theologians and philosophers.
dominic inspired his followers with loyalty to learning and virtue, a deep recognition of the spiritual power of worldly deprivation and the religious state, and a highly developed governmental structure.
the legates agreed to change if they could find a strong leader.
this convent would become the foundation of the dominican nuns, thus making the dominican nuns older than the dominican friars.
in the 20th century the college would be relocated to the convent of saints dominic and sixtus and would be transformed into the pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas, angelicum.
a smaller emphasis on doctrinal activity favoured the development here and there of the ascetic and contemplative life and there sprang up, especially in germany and italy, the mystical movement with which the names of meister eckhart, heinrich suso, johannes tauler, and st. catherine of siena are associated. (
the province of france has produced a large number of preachers.
french dominicans founded and administer the école biblique et archéologique française de jérusalem founded in 1890 by père marie-joseph lagrange o.p. (1855–1938), one of the leading international centres for biblical research.
dominic practiced self-scourging and would mortify himself as he prayed alone in the chapel at night for 'poor sinners.'
also, they should be taught not to be sad if they do not enjoy the divine consolations they hear others have; but they should know the loving father for some reason sometimes withholds these.
one of albert's greatest contributions was his study of dionysus the areopagite, a mystical theologian whose words left an indelible imprint in the medieval period.
magnus' writings made a significant contribution to german mysticism, which became vibrant in the minds of the beguines and women such as hildegard of bingen and mechthild of magdeburg.
thus, contemplation forever produces a mystified, imperfect knowledge of god.
in the strassburg monastery of st. margaret, some of the nuns could converse fluently in latin.
at the center of this environment was love: the love that christ showed for humanity in becoming human.
the idea of the "image of god" demonstrates both the ability of man to move toward god (as partakers in christ's redeeming sacrifice), and that, on some level, man is always an image of god.

eton is one of ten english hmc schools, commonly referred to as "public schools", regulated by the public schools act of 1868.
david cameron is the 19th british prime minister to have attended the school, and has recommended that eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.
according to nevill (citing the historian sir edward creasy), what wellington said, while passing an eton cricket match many decades later, was, "there grows the stuff that won waterloo", a remark nevill construes as a reference to "the manly character induced by games and sport" amongst english youth generally, not a comment about eton specifically.
the statute was removed after the intervention of prime minister harold macmillan in the 1960s after it came to the attention of oxford's wykeham professor of logic, a. j. ayer, himself jewish and an old etonian, who "suspected a whiff of anti-semitism".
the name "king's scholars" is because the school was founded by king henry vi in 1440.
those in existence at present include: aeronautical, african, alexander cozens (art), amnesty, archeological, architectural, astronomy, banks (conservation), caledonian, cheese, classical, comedy, cosmopolitan, debating, design, entrepreneurship, geographical, henry fielding, hispanic, history, keynes (economics), law, literary, mathematical, medical, middle eastern, model united nations, modern languages, oriental, orwell (left-wing), simeon (christian), parry (music), photographic, political, praed (poetry), rock (music), rous (equestrian), salisbury (diplomatic), savile (rare books and manuscripts), shelley, scientific, sports, tech club, theatre, wellington (military), wine and wotton’s (philosophy).

prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.
less common but more severe were the canings administered by pop (see eton society below) in the form of a "pop-tanning", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the president of pop in the presence of all pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke).
eton's best-known holiday takes place on the so-called "fourth of june", a celebration of the birthday of king george iii, eton's greatest patron.
the college paid £200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only.
in april 2011 the labour mp david lammy described as unfair and 'indefensible' the fact that oxford university had organised nine 'outreach events' at eton in 2010, although he admitted that it had, in fact, held fewer such events for eton than for another independent school, wellington college.
other notable old etonians include scientists robert boyle, john maynard smith, j. b. s. haldane, stephen wolfram and the 2012 nobel prize in physiology or medicine winner, john gurdon; beau brummell; economists john maynard keynes and richard layard; antarctic explorer lawrence oates; politician alan clark; entrepreneur, charity organiser and partner of adele, simon konecki; cricket commentator henry blofeld; explorer sir ranulph fiennes; adventurer bear grylls; composers thomas arne, george butterworth, roger quilter, frederick septimus kelly, donald tovey, thomas dunhill, lord berners, victor hely-hutchinson, and peter warlock (philip heseltine); hubert parry, who wrote the song jerusalem and the coronation anthem i was glad; and musicians frank turner and humphrey lyttelton.

located in the north-west of the iberian peninsula, it comprises the provinces of a coruña, lugo, ourense and pontevedra, being bordered by portugal to the south, the spanish autonomous communities of castile and león and asturias to the east, and the atlantic ocean to the west and the north.
the population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas: from ferrol to a coruña in the northwest and from pontevedra to vigo in the southwest.
although the etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors like isidore of seville —who wrote that "galicians are called so, because of their fair skin, as the gauls", relating the name to the greek word for milk—, currently scholars derive the name of the ancient callaeci either from proto-indo-european *kal-n-eh2 'hill', through a local relational suffix -aik-, so meaning 'the hill (people)'; or either from proto-celtic *kallī- 'forest', so meaning 'the forest (people)'.
in any case, galicia, being per se a derivation of the ethnic name kallaikói, would mean 'the land of the galicians'.

some other distinctive features, such as temples, baths, reservoirs, warrior statues and decorative carvings have been found associated to this culture, together with rich gold and metalworking traditions.
in the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the roman empire allowed different tribes of central europe (suebi, vandals and alani) to cross the rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 december 406.
in the 9th century, the rise of the cult of the apostle james in santiago de compostela gave galicia a particular symbolic importance among christians, an importance it would hold throughout the reconquista.
the modern period of the kingdom of galicia began with the murder or defeat of some of the most powerful galician lords, such as pedro álvarez de sotomayor, called pedro madruga, and rodrigo henriquez osorio, at the hands of the castilian armies sent to galicia between the years 1480 and 1486.

the rapid increase of population of a coruña, vigo and to a lesser degree other major galician cities, like ourense, pontevedra or santiago de compostela during the years that followed the spanish civil war during the mid-20th century occurred as the rural population declined: many villages and hamlets of the four provinces of galicia disappeared or nearly disappeared during the same period.
the patron saint of galicia is saint james the greater, whose body was discovered – according to the catholic tradition – in 814 near compostela.
the original usb 1.0 specification, which was introduced in january 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5 mbit/s "low speed" and 12 mbit/s "full speed".
the first widely used version of usb was 1.1, which was released in september 1998.
the payload throughput is 4 gbit/s[citation needed] (due to the overhead incurred by 8b/10b encoding), and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve around 3.2 gbit/s (0.4 gb/s or 400 mb/s), which should increase with future hardware advances.
the usb 3.1 standard increases the data signaling rate to 10 gbit/s in the usb 3.1 gen2 mode, double that of usb 3.0 (referred to as usb 3.1 gen1) and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b.
developed at roughly the same time as the usb 3.1 specification, but distinct from it, the usb type-c specification 1.0 was finalized in august 2014 and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for usb devices.
full-featured usb type-c cables are active, electronically marked cables that contain a chip with an id function based on the configuration data channel and vendor-defined messages (vdms) from the usb power delivery 2.0 specification.
a single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function).
usb implements connections to storage devices using a set of standards called the usb mass storage device class (msc or ums).
though most computers since mid-2004 can boot from usb mass storage devices, usb is not intended as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage.
the micro connector is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection.
the otg device with the b-plug inserted is called the b-device and by default assumes the role of peripheral.
a unit load is defined as 100 ma in usb 1.x and 2.0, and 150 ma in usb 3.0.
a device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in usb 1.x and 2.0 (500 ma), or six unit loads in usb 3.0 (900 ma).
in all cases, both host-to-device and device-to-host configurations are supported.
some usb devices require more power than is permitted by the specifications for a single port.
a usb packet's end, called eop (end-of-packet), is indicated by the transmitter driving 2 bit times of se0 (d+ and d− both below max.)
sometimes skew due to hubs can add as much as one bit time before the se0 of the end of packet.
usb 2.0 devices use a special protocol during reset, called chirping, to negotiate the high bandwidth mode with the host/hub.
these and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses: usb was designed for simplicity and low cost, while firewire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video.
usb has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds.

matthew arnold contrasted "culture" with anarchy; other europeans, following philosophers thomas hobbes and jean-jacques rousseau, contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature".
the sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like marx, durkheim, and weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, where in researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world.
for instance, relationships between popular culture, political control, and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field.
in this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life.

most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared, with prospective application, and possess the characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty, but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law.

exhibition games outside of a structured season are relatively common among indoor american football leagues; because teams switch leagues frequently at that level of play, it is not uncommon to see some of the smaller leagues schedule exhibition games against teams that are from another league, about to join the league as a probational franchise, or a semi-pro outdoor team to fill holes in a schedule.
however, most of the major fbs teams annually schedule early season non-conference preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower-tier fbs, football championship, or division ii schools, which often result in lopsided victories in favor of the fbs teams and act as exhibition games in all but name, though they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school.

the movement started with the first election for the reichstag; those elected were called "les députés protestataires", and until the fall of bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the alsatians to the german parliament demanding the return of those territories to france.
at the last reichstag election in strasbourg and its periphery, the clear winners were the social democrats; the city was the administrative capital of the region, was inhabited by many germans appointed by the central government in berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many germans.

he began his second presidential term in march 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running.
nasser's father was a postal worker born in beni mur in upper egypt and raised in alexandria, and his mother's family came from mallawi, el-minya.

gamal abdel nasser was born on 15 january 1918 in bakos, alexandria, the first son of fahima and abdel nasser hussein.
in 1928, nasser went to alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city's attarin elementary school.
he began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution.
the apparent difference in attitude between the government and the general public increased nasser's determination to topple the monarchy.
soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by prime minister ibrahim abdel hadi regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers.
on 25 january 1952, a confrontation between british forces and police at ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 egyptian policemen, provoking riots in cairo the next day which left 76 people dead.
the muslim brotherhood supported the rcc, and after naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet.
despite the dissolution order, nasser was the only rcc member who still favored holding parliamentary elections, according to his fellow officer abdel latif boghdadi.
later that day, hundreds of thousands of protesters, mainly belonging to the brotherhood, called for naguib's return and nasser's imprisonment.
in january 1955, the rcc appointed him as their president, pending national elections.
when it became apparent to him that western countries would not supply egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, nasser turned to the eastern bloc and concluded a us$320,000,000 armaments agreement with czechoslovakia on 27 september.
in january 1956, the new constitution of egypt was drafted, entailing the establishment of a single-party system under the national union (nu), a movement nasser described as the "cadre through which we will realize our revolution".

nasser later remarked in 1968 that intervention in yemen was a "miscalculation".
during this period, nasser made egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several african countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from cairo.
in 1961, nasser sought to firmly establish egypt as the leader of the arab world and to promote a second revolution in egypt with the purpose of merging islamic and socialist thinking.
according to boghdadi, the stress caused by the uar's collapse and amer's increasing autonomy forced nasser, who already had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on.
earlier that day, nasser received a warning from king hussein of israeli-american collusion to drag egypt into war.
nasser still felt that the us would restrain israel from attacking due to assurances that he received from the us and soviet union.
according to nasser's vice president zakaria mohieddin, although "amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on".
he announced his resignation on television later that day, and ceded all presidential powers to his then-vice president zakaria mohieddin, who had no prior information of this decision and refused to accept the post.

general malaise in egyptian society, particularly during the mubarak era, augmented nostalgia for nasser's presidency, which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose, hope, social cohesion, and vibrant culture.
zakaria mohieddin, who was nasser's vice president, said that nasser gradually changed during his reign.
he defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other arab leaders.
roncalli was elected pope on 28 october 1958 at age 76 after 11 ballots.

the roman catholic church celebrates his feast day not on the date of his death, june 3, as is usual, nor even on the day of his papal inauguration (as is sometimes done with popes who are saints, such as with john paul ii) but on 11 october, the day of the first session of the second vatican council.
many had considered giovanni battista montini, the archbishop of milan, a possible candidate, but, although he was the archbishop of one of the most ancient and prominent sees in italy, he had not yet been made a cardinal.
this was the first time in over 500 years that this name had been chosen; previous popes had avoided its use since the time of the antipope john xxiii during the western schism several centuries before.

one view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe—a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence.
the opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of "container" that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events.
he begins to define time by what it is not rather than what it is, an approach similar to that taken in other negative definitions.
however, augustine ends up calling time a “distention” of the mind (confessions 11.26) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in memory, the present by attention, and the future by expectation.
we are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.
two events in minkowski spacetime are separated by an invariant interval, which can be either space-like, light-like, or time-like.
einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or "warped") by high-speed motion.

the capital stock of the bank is owned by the central banks of all 28 eu member states.[dated info] the treaty of amsterdam established the bank in 1998, and it is headquartered in frankfurt, germany.
the primary objective of the european central bank, as mandated in article 2 of the statute of the ecb, is to maintain price stability within the eurozone.

the spanish had nominated barcelona-born antonio sáinz de vicuña, an ecb veteran who heads its legal department, as gonzález-páramo's replacement as early as january 2012 but alternatives from luxembourg, finland, and slovenia were put forward and no decision made by may. after a long political battle, luxembourg's yves mersch, was appointed as gonzález-páramo's replacement.
to offer some accountability, the ecb is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the european parliament, the european commission, the council of the european union and the european council.
greece had the greatest need for reforms but also most problems to implement those, so the greek exit, also called "grexit", has been widely discussed.
germany, as a large and financially stable state being in the focus to be asked to guarantee or repay other states debt, has never pushed those exits.
this would imply, as a quid pro quo, adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets.
rescue operations involving sovereign debt have included temporarily moving bad or weak assets off the balance sheets of the weak member banks into the balance sheets of the european central bank.
the latter can be seen, for example, in the bank's intervention during the subprime mortgage crisis when it loaned billions of euros to banks to stabilise the financial system.
finally, it contributes to maintaining a stable financial system and monitoring the banking sector.
in december 2007, the ecb decided in conjunction with the federal reserve system under a programme called term auction facility to improve dollar liquidity in the eurozone and to stabilise the money market.

in july 2005, the flight was duplicated by american aviator and adventurer steve fossett in a replica vickers vimy aircraft, with st. john's international airport substituting for lester's field (now an urban and residential part of the city).
after a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the hibernia, terra nova and white rose oil fields has led to an economic boom that has spurred population growth and commercial development.
the city is one of the rainiest in canada outside of coastal british columbia.
on average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from october to january, with december the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average.

instead, governesses taught von neumann, his brothers and his cousins.
at the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst gábor szegő.
by the age of 19, von neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded georg cantor's definition.
at the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von neumann sat for and won the eötvös prize, a national prize for mathematics.
so it was decided that the best career path was to become a chemical engineer.
at the same time, von neumann also entered pázmány péter university in budapest, as a ph.d. candidate in mathematics.
for his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of cantor's set theory.
von neumann's habilitation was completed on december 13, 1927, and he started his lectures as a privatdozent at the university of berlin in 1928.
a strongly negative answer arrived in september 1930 at the historic mathematical congress of königsberg, in which kurt gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language.
but von neumann, who had participated at the congress, confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker, and in less than a month was able to communicate to gödel himself an interesting consequence of his theorem: namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency.
in a series of famous papers, von neumann made spectacular contributions to measure theory.
in 1938, he was awarded the bôcher memorial prize for his work in analysis.
however, in 2010, jeffrey bub argued that bell had misconstrued von neumann's proof, and pointed out that the proof, though not valid for all hidden variable theories, does rule out a well-defined and important subset.
over the following two years, he also became a consultant to the central intelligence agency (cia), a member of the influential general advisory committee of the atomic energy commission, a consultant to the newly established lawrence livermore national laboratory, and a member of the scientific advisory group of the united states air force.
von neumann entered government service (manhattan project) primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the us would triumph over totalitarianism from nazism, fascism and soviet communism.
von neumann was a founding figure in computing.
although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von neumann architecture as a result of von neumann's paper, the architecture's description was based on the work of j. presper eckert and john william mauchly, inventors of the eniac computer at the university of pennsylvania.
however, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s.
noting that the earth was only 6 °f (3.3 °c) colder during the last glacial period, he noted that the burning of coal and oil "a general warming of the earth by about one degree fahrenheit."
eugene wigner wrote that, seeing von neumann's mind at work, "one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch."
lothar wolfgang nordheim described von neumann as the "fastest mind i ever met", and jacob bronowski wrote "he was the cleverest man i ever knew, without exception.

furthermore, ps3 had to compete directly with xbox 360 which had a market head start, and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the ps2 enjoyed such as the grand theft auto and final fantasy series (regarding cross-platform games, xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006, although by 2008 the ps3 versions had reached parity or surpassed), and it took longer than expected for ps3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with xbox 360.
playstation 3's initial production cost is estimated by isuppli to have been us$805.85 for the 20 gb model and us$840.35 for the 60 gb model.
in april 2007, soon after these results were published, ken kutaragi, president of sony computer entertainment, announced plans to retire.
in january 2008, kaz hirai, ceo of sony computer entertainment, suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, "the next fiscal year starts in april and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" and that "[profitability] is not a definite commitment, but that is what i would like to try to shoot for".
however, ps3 has won ign's "console showdown"—based on which console offers the best selection of games released during each year—in three of the four years since it began (2008, 2009 and 2011, with xbox winning in 2010).
ps3 was given the number-eight spot on pc world magazine's list of "the top 21 tech screwups of 2006", where it was criticized for being "late, expensive and incompatible".
he believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console.
activision blizzard ceo bobby kotick has criticized ps3's high development costs and inferior attach rate and return to that of xbox 360 and wii.
in addition, both home theater magazine and ultimate av have given the system's blu-ray playback very favorable reviews, stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone blu-ray disc players.
despite the initial negative press, several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware.
cnet awarded ps3 slim four out of five stars praising its blu-ray capabilities, 120 gb hard drive, free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point, but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for playstation 2 games.
techradar gave ps3 slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating "over all, the ps3 slim is a phenomenal piece of kit.
they did praise that the hard drive of the super slim model is "the easiest yet.
in the united kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the house of lords or may appoint lords commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the palace of westminster.
in the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the united kingdom, norway, and liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government.
the body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the house of lords, while the shire and borough representatives formed the house of commons.
the power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs.
charles i dissolved parliament in 1629, after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power.
later hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: george iii and george iv both openly opposed catholic emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a catholic emancipation bill would violate the coronation oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established church of england from papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy.
after a bill has been passed, the presiding officer of the scottish parliament submits it to the monarch for royal assent after a four-week period, during which the advocate general for scotland, the lord advocate, the attorney general or the secretary of state for scotland may refer the bill to the supreme court of the united kingdom (prior to 1 october 2009, the judicial committee of the privy council) for review of its legality.

before 1994, royal assent was granted by order in council, as for a bill, but the power to grant royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor.
if approved by tynwald, a measure "shall have the force and effect of an act of tynwald upon the royal assent thereto being announced to tynwald".
if the governor general of canada is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the deputy of the governor general of canada—the chief justice of canada—or another justice of the supreme court of canada.
however, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the house of commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the journals of the house of commons, whereas the senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.
even after colonies such as canada, australia, new zealand, the union of south africa, and newfoundland were granted responsible government, the british government continued to sometimes advise governors-general on the granting of assent; assent was also occasionally reserved to allow the british government to examine a bill before advising the governor-general.
the error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the house.
the same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.
however, it was later discovered that it had not been passed by each house.
during the 1960s, the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year, at the end of the annual parliamentary session.
in canada, the traditional ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long after it had been discontinued in the united kingdom and other commonwealth realms.
one result, conceived as part of a string of royal duties intended to demonstrate canada's status as an independent kingdom, was that king george vi personally assented to nine bills of the canadian parliament during the 1939 royal tour of canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, queen victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the united kingdom.
the royal assent ceremony takes place in the senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the house of commons.
if there are any appropriation bills to receive royal assent, the speaker of the house of commons will read their titles and the senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate royal assent.
article 93 of that document gives the jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the national assembly; if he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses; otherwise, the law does not go into effect (but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly).
should the sovereign ever choose to exercise this privilege, article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden: "if a bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the storting, without a divergent bill having been passed by any storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the king with a petition that his majesty shall not refuse his assent to a bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the royal assent is not accorded before the storting goes into recess."
according to article 91, within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the cortes generales, the sovereign shall give his or her assent and publish the new law.
title iv of the 1978 spanish constitution invests the consentimiento real (royal assent) and promulgation (publication) of laws with the monarch of spain, while title iii, the cortes generales, chapter 2, drafting of bills, outlines the method by which bills are passed.

when the spanish media asked king juan carlos if he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriages, he answered "soy el rey de españa y no el de bélgica" ("i am the king of spain and not that of belgium")—a reference to king baudouin i of belgium, who had refused to sign the belgian law legalising abortion.
in 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with king george tupou v saying that he would be guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers.
conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.t[›] symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects.
matrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication.
via euler angles, rotation matrices are used in computer graphics.
mathematicians often strive for a complete classification (or list) of a mathematical notion.
in order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be continuous functions, that is, g • h, and g−1 must not vary wildly if g and h vary only little.
galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the absolute galois group can also be equipped with a topology, the so-called krull topology, which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions.
an advanced generalization of this idea, adapted to the needs of algebraic geometry, is the étale fundamental group.
the central african republic (car; sango: ködörösêse tî bêafrîka; french: république centrafricaine  pronounced: [ʁepyblik sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn], or centrafrique [sɑ̃tʀafʁik]) is a landlocked country in central africa.
it is bordered by chad to the north, sudan to the northeast, south sudan to the east, the democratic republic of the congo and the republic of the congo to the south and cameroon to the west.

the car covers a land area of about 620,000 square kilometres (240,000 sq mi) and had an estimated population of around 4.7 million as of 2014[update].
in 1920 french equatorial africa was established and ubangi-shari was administered from brazzaville.
a new constitution was approved on 28 december 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics.
in 2006, due to ongoing violence, over 50,000 people in the country's northwest were at risk of starvation but this was averted due to assistance from the united nations.[citation needed] on 8 january 2008, the un secretary-general ban ki-moon declared that the central african republic was eligible to receive assistance from the peacebuilding fund.
for most central africans, the informal economy of the car is more important than the formal economy.[citation needed] export trade is hindered by poor economic development and the country's landlocked position.[citation needed]

a number of other health conditions occur more frequently in those with asthma, including gastro-esophageal reflux disease (gerd), rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea.
the hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.
asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).
many cases however are not reported or recognized as such.
laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.
rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%.
by contrast, the format was much more popular in japan and in the more affluent regions of southeast asia, such as hong kong, singapore, and malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in hong kong during the 1990s.
it was chosen by the british broadcasting corporation (bbc) for the bbc domesday project in the mid-1980s, a school-based project to commemorate 900 years since the original domesday book in england.

caa55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of digital audio.
another type marketed by onkyo and others converted the rf ac-3 signal to 6-channel analog audio.
due to the larger volume of demand, videocassettes quickly became much cheaper to duplicate, costing as little as $1.00 by the beginning of the 1990s.
it was claimed that macrovision's copyguard protection could not be applied to laserdisc, due to the format's design.
laserdisc's support for multiple audio tracks allowed for vast supplemental materials to be included on-disc and made it the first available format for "special edition" releases; the 1984 criterion collection edition of citizen kane is generally credited as being the first "special edition" release to home video,[citation needed] and for setting the standard by which future se discs were measured.
in contrast, the digital mpeg-2 format information used on dvds has built-in error correction which ensures that the signal from a damaged disc will remain identical to that from a perfect disc right up until the point at which damage to the disc surface is so substantial that it prevents the laser from being able to identify usable data.
in addition, laserdisc videos sometimes exhibit a problem known as "crosstalk".
in the 1990s, notable players sold for anywhere from us$200 to well over $1,000, while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $25.
this was a problem that was termed "laser rot" among ld enthusiasts, also called "color flash" internally by laserdisc-pressing plants.
until the end of 2001, many titles were released on vhs, ld, and dvd in japan.
apple's hypercard scripting language provided macintosh computer users with a means to design databases of slides, animation, video and sounds from laserdiscs and then to create interfaces for users to play specific content from the disc through software called laserstacks.
commercially available stacks were also popular with the voyager company being possibly the most successful distributor.
players and discs were never officially sold in north america, although several distributors imported muse discs along with other import titles.
squeeze lds were enhanced 16:9-ratio widescreen laserdiscs.
since very few people owned 16:9 displays, the marketability of these special discs was very limited.
he was rated as a midshipman aboard hms collingwood on 15 september 1913, and spent three months in the mediterranean.
after his closing speech at the british empire exhibition at wembley on 31 october 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see lionel logue, an australian-born speech therapist.
his journey by sea to australia, new zealand and fiji took him via jamaica, where albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.
the day before the abdication, he went to london to see his mother, queen mary.
in settling the issue, george's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title and style "his royal highness the duke of windsor", but the letters patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles.
in may and june 1939, the king and queen toured canada and the united states.
the terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the latin word foedus, meaning treaty, pact or covenant.
when the u.s. constitution was being drafted, the federalist party supported a stronger central government, while "anti-federalists" wanted a weaker central government.
most people politically advocating "federalism" in the united states argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the judiciary (see federalist society, new federalism).
in brazil, the fall of the monarchy in 1889 by a military coup d'état led to the rise of the presidential system, headed by deodoro da fonseca.
article 371 makes special provisions for the states of andhra pradesh, arunachal pradesh, assam, goa, mizoram, manipur, nagaland and sikkim as per their accession or state-hood deals.
federalism, and other forms of territorially autonomy, is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order prevent violence among different groups with countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level.

on one hand, this means that the belgian political landscape, generally speaking, consists of only two components: the dutch-speaking population represented by dutch-language political parties, and the majority populations of wallonia and brussels, represented by their french-speaking parties.
where a federation has a bicameral legislature the upper house is often used to represent the component states while the lower house represents the people of the nation as a whole.
over the years various modifications have been proposed to the constitution of the philippines, including possible transition to a federal system as part of a shift to a parliamentary system.
following the partition of ireland in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign irish free state (which eventually evolved into the modern day republic of ireland), northern ireland retained its devolved government through the parliament of northern ireland, the only part of the uk to have such a body at this time.
the regions of england continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions.
each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members.
in almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as exclusive federal powers.
the annelids are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, coelomate, invertebrate organisms.
since annelids are soft-bodied, their fossils are rare – mostly jaws and the mineralized tubes that some of the species secreted.
most of an annelid's body consists of segments that are practically identical, having the same sets of internal organs and external chaetae (greek χαιτη, meaning "hair") and, in some species, appendages.
annelids' cuticles are made of collagen fibers, usually in layers that spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other.
below this are two layers of muscles, which develop from the lining of the coelom (body cavity): circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract, while under them are longitudinal muscles, usually four distinct strips, whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter.
the brains of polychaetes are generally in the prostomium, while those of clitellates are in the peristomium or sometimes the first segment behind the peristomium.
nuchal ("on the neck") organs are paired, ciliated structures found only in polychaetes, and are thought to be chemosensors.
most annelids have a pair of coelomata (body cavities) in each segment, separated from other segments by septa and from each other by vertical mesenteries.
in some species coelomocytes may also contain a respiratory pigment – red hemoglobin in some species, green chlorocruorin in others (dissolved in the plasma) – and provide oxygen transport within their segments.
in leeches there are no septa, the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body, and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body.
however, in members of the tube-dwelling family siboglinidae the gut is blocked by a swollen lining that houses symbiotic bacteria, which can make up 15% of the worms' total weight.
about 14% use a similar external fertilization but produce yolk-rich eggs, which reduce the time the larva needs to spend among the plankton, or eggs from which miniature adults emerge rather than larvae.
the rear end of the palolo worm, a marine polychaete that tunnels through coral, detaches in order to spawn at the surface, and the people of samoa regard these spawning modules as a delicacy.
anglers sometimes find that worms are more effective bait than artificial flies, and worms can be kept for several days in a tin lined with damp moss.
until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes canadia and burgessochaeta, both from canada's burgess shale, formed about 505 million years ago in the early cambrian.
myoscolex, found in australia and a little older than the burgess shale, was possibly an annelid.
the earliest good evidence for oligochaetes occurs in the tertiary period, which began 65 million years ago, and it has been suggested that these animals evolved around the same time as flowering plants in the early cretaceous, from 130 to 90 million years ago.
for many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher-level groups.
in 2007 torsten struck and colleagues compared 3 genes in 81 taxa, of which 9 were outgroups, in other words not considered closely related to annelids but included to give an indication of where the organisms under study are placed on the larger tree of life.
it also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into scolecida, canalipalpata and aciculata was useless, as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa.
the concept of god as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence.

because god is conceived as not being a corporeal being, god cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize god because of his deed of creating man's mind in the image of his own.
in theism, god is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, god is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe.
monotheism is the belief in the existence of one god or in the oneness of god.
in islam, the name allah, "al-el", or "al-elah" ("the god") is used, while muslims also have a multitude of titular names for god.
the reconstructed proto-indo-european form * ǵhu-tó-m was likely based on the root * ǵhau(ə)-, which meant either "to call" or "to invoke".
another view, advanced by richard dawkins, is that the existence of god is an empirical question, on the grounds that "a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without, and it would be a scientific difference."
stephen hawking and co-author leonard mlodinow state in their book, the grand design, that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is god, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created god.
pascal boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world, in general, supernatural beings tend to behave much like people.
for spinoza, the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance, god, or its equivalent, nature.
the gender of god may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form.
muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship god.
the origins of al-qaeda can be traced to the soviet war in afghanistan (december 1979 – february 1989).
on 7 august 1998, al-qaeda struck the u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 americans.
on the morning of 11 september 2001, 19 men affiliated with al-qaeda hijacked four airliners all bound for california.
in september 2014, afghanistan and the united states signed a security agreement, which permits united states and nato forces to remain in afghanistan until at least 2024.
on 14 september 2009, u.s. special forces killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the somali village of baarawe.

they launched operation serval on 11 january 2013, with the hopes of dislodging the al-qaeda affiliated groups from northern mali.
following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities (but not officially ended) in the 1991 gulf war, the united states and its allies instituted and began patrolling iraqi no-fly zones, to protect iraq's kurdish and shi'a arab population—both of which suffered attacks from the hussein regime before and after the gulf war—in iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively.
the following day on 10 september 2014 president barack obama made a televised speech about isil, which he stated "our objective is clear: we will degrade, and ultimately destroy, isil through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy".
musharraf agreed to give the u.s. the use of three airbases for operation enduring freedom.
united states secretary of state colin powell and other u.s. administration officials met with musharraf.
in 2002, the musharraf-led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism, and arrested maulana masood azhar, head of the jaish-e-mohammed, and hafiz muhammad saeed, chief of the lashkar-e-taiba, and took dozens of activists into custody.

on 22 november 2002, the member states of the euro-atlantic partnership council (eapc) decided on a partnership action plan against terrorism, which explicitly states, "eapc states are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism."
even so, many of the "coalition of the willing" countries that unconditionally supported the u.s.-led military action have sent troops to afghanistan, particular neighboring pakistan, which has disowned its earlier support for the taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict.
on 30 july 2003, the american civil liberties union (aclu) filed the first legal challenge against section 215 of the patriot act, claiming that it allows the fbi to violate a citizen's first amendment rights, fourth amendment rights, and right to due process, by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.
in 2005, the un security council adopted resolution 1624 concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws.
thus, with the acquiescence of asquith's liberals, ramsay macdonald became the first ever labour prime minister in january 1924, forming the first labour government, despite labour only having 191 mps (less than a third of the house of commons).
in the 2010 general election on 6 may that year, labour with 29.0% of the vote won the second largest number of seats (258).
between january and march 2008, the labour party received just over £3 million in donations and were £17 million in debt; compared to the conservatives' £6 million in donations and £12 million in debt.
"new labour" was first termed as an alternative branding for the labour party, dating from a conference slogan first used by the labour party in 1994, which was later seen in a draft manifesto published by the party in 1996, called new labour, new life for britain.
established on 24 february 1918, the republic of estonia came into existence towards the end of world war i. during world war ii, estonia was then occupied by the soviet union in 1940, then nazi germany a year later and again in 1944 establishing the estonian soviet socialist republic.
in the first centuries ad, political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in estonia.
on st. george's night (estonian: jüriöö ülestõus) 23 april 1343, the indigenous estonian population in the duchy of estonia, the bishopric of ösel-wiek and the insular territories of the state of the teutonic order tried to rid themselves of the danish and german rulers and landlords, who had conquered the country in the 13th century during the livonian crusade, and to eradicate the non-indigenous christian religion.
as a result of the abolition of serfdom and the availability of education to the native estonian-speaking population, an active estonian nationalist movement developed in the 19th century.[citation needed] it began on a cultural level, resulting in the establishment of estonian language literature, theatre and professional music and led on to the formation of the estonian national identity and the age of awakening.
on 14 june, while the world's attention was focused on the fall of paris to nazi germany a day earlier, the soviet military blockade on estonia went into effect, two soviet bombers downed the finnish passenger aeroplane "kaleva" flying from tallinn to helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the us delegations in tallinn, riga and helsinki.
after germany invaded the soviet union on 22 june 1941, the wehrmacht crossed the estonian southern border on 7 july.
although many estonians were recruited into the german armed forces (including estonian waffen-ss), the majority of them did so only in 1944 when the threat of a new invasion of estonia by the red army had become imminent.
half the deported perished, and the other half were not allowed to return until the early 1960s (years after stalin's death).[citation needed] the activities of soviet forces in 1940–41 and after reoccupation sparked a guerrilla war against soviet authorities in estonia by the forest brothers, who consisted mostly of estonian veterans of the german and finnish armies and some civilians.
as the 1980s progressed, a movement for estonian autonomy started.
estonia lies on the eastern shores of the baltic sea immediately across the gulf of finland from finland on the level northwestern part of the rising east european platform between 57.3° and 59.5° n and 21.5° and 28.1° e. average elevation reaches only 50 metres (164 ft) and the country's highest point is the suur munamägi in the southeast at 318 metres (1,043 ft).
the estonian parliament has 101 members and influences the governing of the state primarily by determining the income and the expenses of the state (establishing taxes and adopting the budget).
at the same time the parliament has the right to present statements, declarations and appeals to the people of estonia, ratify and denounce international treaties with other states and international organisations and decide on the government loans.
the prime minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen.
the first internet voting took place in the 2005 local elections and the first in a parliamentary election was made available for the 2007 elections, in which 30,275 individuals voted over the internet.
the supreme judicial power is vested in the supreme court or riigikohus, with nineteen justices.
an important element in estonia's post-independence reorientation has been closer ties with the nordic countries, especially finland and sweden.
estonia co-operates with latvia and lithuania in several trilateral baltic defence co-operation initiatives, including baltic battalion (baltbat), baltic naval squadron (baltron), baltic air surveillance network (baltnet) and joint military educational institutions such as the baltic defence college in tartu.
in 2007, a military doctrine of an e-military of estonia was officially introduced as the country was under massive cyberattacks in 2007.
in recent years many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources.[citation needed] the importance of wind power has been increasing steadily in estonia and currently the total amount of energy production from wind is nearly 60 mw while at the same time roughly 399 mw worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800 mw worth of projects are being proposed in the lake peipus area and the coastal areas of hiiumaa.
estonia also exports 1.562 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually.
at the end of the 1980s, estonians perceived their demographic change as a national catastrophe.
the 2008 united nations human rights council report called "extremely credible" the description of the citizenship policy of estonia as "discriminatory".
another major group, inhabitants who follow eastern orthodox christianity, practised chiefly by the russian minority, and the russian orthodox church is the second largest denomination with 150,000 members.
the largest public universities are the university of tartu, tallinn university of technology, tallinn university, estonian university of life sciences, estonian academy of arts; the largest private university is estonian business school.
the first computer centres were established in the late 1950s in tartu and tallinn.
originates livoniae in chronicle of henry of livonia contains estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences.
anton hansen tammsaare's social epic and psychological realist pentalogy truth and justice captured the evolution of estonian society from a peasant community to an independent nation.
also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage, this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states.
unimak island, for example, is home to mount shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet (3,048 m) above the north pacific.
of the remaining land area, the state of alaska owns 101 million acres (41 million hectares), its entitlement under the alaska statehood act.
the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887, when president grover cleveland, and later the u.s. congress, granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla.
the gwich'in people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested arctic national wildlife refuge.

alaska also has the largest quaker population (by percentage) of any state.
the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction.
tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.
the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.
from its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.
the state capital, juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from haines.
the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska.
the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham, washington and prince rupert, british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway.

in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations.
popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method, in favour of empirical falsification: a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments.
after the street battle in the hörlgasse on 15 june 1919, when police shot eight of his unarmed party comrades, he became disillusioned by what he saw to be the "pseudo-scientific" historical materialism of marx, abandoned the ideology, and remained a supporter of social liberalism throughout his life.
continuing to attend university as a guest student, he started an apprenticeship as cabinetmaker, which he completed as a journeyman.
fearing the rise of nazism and the threat of the anschluss, he started to use the evenings and the nights to write his first book die beiden grundprobleme der erkenntnistheorie (the two fundamental problems of the theory of knowledge).
popper's manuscripts went to the hoover institution at stanford university, partly during his lifetime and partly as supplementary material after his death.
he had at one point joined a socialist association, and for a few months in 1919 considered himself a communist.
the failure of democratic parties to prevent fascism from taking over austrian politics in the 1920s and 1930s traumatised popper.
he suffered from the direct consequences of this failure, since events after the anschluss, the annexation of austria by the german reich in 1938, forced him into permanent exile.
popper thought that einstein's theory, as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method, was highly "risky", in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the light of the then-dominant newtonian physics, highly improbable (e.g., that light is deflected towards solid bodies—confirmed by eddington's experiments in 1919), and which would, if they turned out to be false, falsify the whole theory.
as such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of world three.
for example, he famously stated "darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program—a possible framework for testable scientific theories."
popper contrasts his views with the notion of the "hopeful monster" that has large phenotype mutations and calls it the "hopeful behavioural monster".
about the creation-evolution controversy, popper wrote that he considered it "a somewhat sensational clash between a brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning the history of the various species of animals and plants on earth, and an older metaphysical theory which, incidentally, happened to be part of an established religious belief" with a footnote to the effect that "[he] agree[s] with professor c.e. raven when, in his science, religion, and the future, 1943, he calls this conflict "a storm in a victorian tea-cup"; though the force of this remark is perhaps a little impaired by the attention he pays to the vapours still emerging from the cup—to the great systems of evolutionist philosophy, produced by bergson, whitehead, smuts, and others."
popper played a vital role in establishing the philosophy of science as a vigorous, autonomous discipline within philosophy, through his own prolific and influential works, and also through his influence on his own contemporaries and students.
popper founded in 1946 the department of philosophy, logic and scientific method at the london school of economics and there lectured and influenced both imre lakatos and paul feyerabend, two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science. (
he does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true, or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist.[citation needed] rather, it is recommended as an essential principle of methodology that, if enacted by a system or community, will lead to slow but steady progress of a sort (relative to how well the system or community enacts the method).
also, in his collection conjectures and refutations: the growth of scientific knowledge (harper & row, 1963), popper writes, "science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices.
rather than offering a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science, popper makes it clear in the logic of scientific discovery that his belief is that the resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations can only be a matter of the collective judgment of scientists, in each individual case.
in 2004, philosopher and psychologist michel ter hark (groningen, the netherlands) published a book, called popper, otto selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology, in which he claimed that popper took some of his ideas from his tutor, the german psychologist otto selz.
indeed, popper wrote, several decades before gray's criticism, in reply to a critical essay by imre lakatos:
it is impossible, popper argues, to ensure a theory to be true; it is more important that its falsity can be detected as easily as possible.
the riot had, in fact, been part of a plan by which leaders of the communist party with connections to béla kun tried to take power by a coup; popper did not know about this at that time.
a mandolin (italian: mandolino pronounced [mandoˈliːno]; literally "small mandola") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or "pick".
there is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop.
an early extant example of a mandolin is one built by antonio vinaccia in 1759, which resides at the university of edinburgh.
the mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years, in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians, and in the concert hall.
even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century, new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music.
another family of bowlback mandolins came from milan and lombardy.
the instruments have 6 strings, 3 wire treble-strings and 3 gut or wire-wrapped-silk bass-strings.
samuel adelstein described the lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the neapolitan mandolin, with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck, with six single strings to the regular mandolin's set of 4.
travelling mandolin virtuosi like giuseppe pettine, raffaele calace and silvio ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a "fad" instrument in the early 20th century.
phil skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in australia, and was awarded an mbe in 1979 for services to music and the community.
he was born harry skinner in sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo.
most of these works have been released on compact disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the abc and mbs networks.
one of their members, mandolin virtuoso paul hooper, has had a number of concertos written for him by composers such as eric gross.
in the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras (estudiantinas) were active in belgium.
she is now also professor mandolin at the music high school “koninklijk conservatorium artesis hogeschool antwerpen”.
prior to the golden age of mandolins, france had a history with the mandolin, with mandolinists playing in paris until the napoleonic wars.
in indian classical music and indian light music, the mandolin, which bears little resemblance to the european mandolin, is usually tuned e-b-e-b. as there is no concept of absolute pitch in indian classical music, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used.
japanese mandolin orchestras today may consist of up to 40 or 50 members, and can include woodwind, percussion, and brass sections.
today you can see mandolins as part of the traditional and folk culture of portuguese singing groups and the majority of the mandolin scene in portugal is in madeira island.
at the time, partee was using an imported french-made mandolin.
prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include samuel firstman, howard fry, rudy cipolla, dave apollon, neil gladd, evan marshall, marilynn mair and mark davis (the mair-davis duo), brian israel, david evans, emanuil shynkman, radim zenkl, david del tredici and ernst krenek.
when cowan powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter orpha powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin.
other blues players from the era's string bands include willie black (whistler and his jug band), dink brister, jim hill, charles johnson, coley jones (dallas string band), bobby leecan (need more band), alfred martin, charlie mccoy (1909-1950), al miller, matthew prater, and herb quinn.
1 hit maggie may features a significant mandolin riff.
today, venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as alberto valderrama, jesus rengel, ricardo sandoval, saul vera, and cristobal soto.
adult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming (see below, locomotion).
adult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming (see below, locomotion).
as it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles.
insect" first appears documented in english in 1601 in holland's translation of pliny.
conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms.
plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins.

archaeognatha make up the monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while thysanura and pterygota are grouped together as dicondylia.
traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics have usually given the hexapoda the rank of superclass,:180 and identified four groups within it: insects (ectognatha), springtails (collembola), protura, and diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts.
paleoptera and neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen.
matters that have incurred controversy include strepsiptera and diptera grouped together as halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community.
the segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen.
the anterior segment, closest to the head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum.
the insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers: the epicuticle, which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle.
insects are the only invertebrates to have developed active flight capability, and this has played an important role in their success.:186 their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.

once food leaves the crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in numbered diagram), also known as the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place.
the rectum absorbs 90% of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion.
the follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside.
gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange.:65–68 during continuous gas exchange, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle.
an insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth.
a few insects, such as members of the families poduridae and onychiuridae (collembola), mycetophilidae (diptera) and the beetle families lampyridae, phengodidae, elateridae and staphylinidae are bioluminescent.
many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements.
vibrations can also be used to communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way.
chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell.
these chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information.
social insects, such as termites, ants and many bees and wasps, are the most familiar species of eusocial animal.
in this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown.:309–311 though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors.
in a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location up to a year after last viewing the area of interest.
the eusocial insects build nest, guard eggs, and provide food for offspring full-time (see eusociality).
the adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food.
many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait.
a few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, especially members of the gerridae family, commonly known as water striders.
another defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry.
insectivorous insects, or insects which feed on other insects, are beneficial to humans because they eat insects that could cause damage to agriculture and human structures.
insects play important roles in biological research.
because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like dna replication or transcription in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans.
insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition.:10–13 in most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.
in the case of the 'san' bush-men of the kalahari, it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.:9
while some researchers sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way,[page needed] and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, homo sapiens, and subspecies, homo sapiens sapiens.
when people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved.
these constructs develop within various legal, economic, and sociopolitical contexts, and may be the effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations.
while race is understood to be a social construct by many, most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized practices of preference and discrimination.
in this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought europeans into contact with groups from different continents, and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences.
the first post-classical published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be françois bernier's nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent ("new division of earth by the different species or races which inhabit it"), published in 1684.
but the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the white, european race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes.
homo sapiens europaeus was described as active, acute, and adventurous, whereas homo sapiens afer was said to be crafty, lazy, and careless.
according to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct.
it was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups.
in the last two decades of the 18th century, the theory of polygenism, the belief that different races had evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor, was advocated in england by historian edward long and anatomist charles white, in germany by ethnographers christoph meiners and georg forster, and in france by julien-joseph virey.
polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century, culminating in the founding of the anthropological society of london (1863) during the period of the american civil war, in opposition to the ethnological society, which had abolitionist sympathies.
race anthropologists were pressured to acknowledge findings coming from studies of culture and population genetics, and to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation.
in 1978, sewall wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should, in general, be considered different subspecies by the usual criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection.
often taxonomists prefer to use phylogenetic analysis to determine whether a population can be considered a subspecies.
the smooth gradation of human genetic variation in general tends to rule out any idea that human population groups can be considered monophyletic (cleanly divided), as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations.
for empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation, which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in packages that can be labeled races."
as the anthropologists leonard lieberman and fatimah linda jackson observed, "discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous".
as the anthropologists leonard lieberman and fatimah linda jackson observed, "discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous".
however, about 5% of human variation occurs between populations within continents, therefore fst values between continental groups of humans (or races) of as low as 0.1 (or possibly lower) have been found in some studies, suggesting more moderate levels of genetic variation.
graves (1996) has countered that fst should not be used as a marker of subspecies status, as the statistic is used to measure the degree of differentiation between populations, although see also wright (1978).
early human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each other.
alongside empirical and conceptual problems with "race", following the second world war, evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide.
the european union uses the terms racial origin and ethnic origin synonymously in its documents and according to it "the use of the term 'racial origin' in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such [racial] theories".[full citation needed] haney lópez warns that using "race" as a category within the law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination.
unlike the united states, britain, or even the netherlands, france maintains a "color-blind" model of public policy.
this rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible african ancestry were defined as black.
2009) in 2002–2003 surveyed european anthropologists' opinions toward the biological race concept.
eduardo bonilla-silva, sociology professor at duke university, remarks, "i contend that racism is, more than anything else, a matter of group power; it is about a dominant racial group (whites) striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo."
since 1932, an increasing number of college textbooks introducing physical anthropology have rejected race as a valid concept: from 1932 to 1976, only seven out of thirty-two rejected race; from 1975 to 1984, thirteen out of thirty-three rejected race; from 1985 to 1993, thirteen out of nineteen rejected race.
the authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as douglas j. futuyama's 1986 "evolutionary biology" had abandoned the race concept, "the concept of race, masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions, is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well (pp.
in an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of law enforcement officers seeking to apprehend suspects, the united states fbi employs the term "race" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend.

in the united states, the practice of racial profiling has been ruled to be both unconstitutional and a violation of civil rights.
many consider de facto racial profiling an example of institutional racism in law enforcement.
the history of misuse of racial categories to impact adversely one or more groups and/or to offer protection and advantage to another has a clear impact on debate of the legitimate use of known phenotypical or genotypical characteristics tied to the presumed race of both victims and perpetrators by the government.
who sought to distinguish between the y chromosomes of jewish priests (kohanim), (in judaism, membership in the priesthood is passed on through the father's line) and the y chromosomes of non-jews.
abu el-haj concluded that this new "race science" calls attention to the importance of "ancestry" (narrowly defined, as it does not include all ancestors) in some religions and in popular culture, and people's desire to use science to confirm their claims about ancestry; this "race science", she argues, is fundamentally different from older notions of race that were used to explain differences in human behaviour or social status:

apollo (attic, ionic, and homeric greek: ἀπόλλων, apollōn (gen ἀπόλλωνος); doric: ἀπέλλων, apellōn; arcadocypriot: ἀπείλων, apeilōn; aeolic: ἄπλουν, aploun; latin: apollō) is one of the most important and complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology.
as the patron of delphi (pythian apollo), apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle.
it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios (ἀπελλαῖος), and the offerings apellaia (ἀπελλαῖα) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (ἀπέλλαι).
in the ancient macedonian language πέλλα (pella) means "stone," and some toponyms may be derived from this word: πέλλα (pella, the capital of ancient macedonia) and πελλήνη (pellēnē/pallene).
the inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from anatolia.
the connection with dorians and their initiation festival apellai[clarification needed] is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars, but it can explain only the doric type of the name, which is connected with the ancient macedonian word "pella" (pella), stone.

in september 2003, retired four-star general wesley clark announced his intention to run in the presidential primary election for the democratic party nomination.
this advanced the suggestion that kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns; it also encapsulated kerry's contention that bush had alienated american allies by his foreign policy.
bush (just as his father did with dukakis in the 1988 election) also sought to portray kerry as a "massachusetts liberal" who was out of touch with mainstream americans.
bush attempted to deflect criticism of what was described as his scowling demeanor during the first debate, joking at one point about one of kerry's remarks, "that answer made me want to scowl."
bush and kerry met for the third and final debate at arizona state university on october 13.
all ten electors in the state cast ballots for john edwards for vice president (john edwards's name was spelled correctly on all ballots for vice president).
at the invitation of the united states government, the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) sent a team of observers to monitor the presidential elections in 2004.
named for a section of the internal revenue code, these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes as long as they do not coordinate their activities with political campaigns.
at that time the liberals' coalition partner, the country party, the older of the two in the coalition (now known as the "national party"), had considerable influence over the government's economic policies.
domestically, menzies presided over a fairly regulated economy in which utilities were publicly owned, and commercial activity was highly regulated through centralised wage-fixing and high tariff protection.
the menzies government entered australia's first formal military alliance outside of the british commonwealth with the signing of the anzus treaty between australia, new zealand and the united states in san francisco in 1951.
in 1954 the menzies government signed the south east asia collective defence treaty (seato) as a south east asian counterpart to nato.
in 1958 the government replaced the immigration act's arbitrarily applied european language dictation test with an entry permit system, that reflected economic and skills criteria.
the gorton government increased funding for the arts, setting up the australian council for the arts, the australian film development corporation and the national film and television training school.
liberal minister, don chipp split off from the party to form a new social liberal party, the australian democrats in 1977.
howard differed from his labor predecessor paul keating in that he supported traditional australian institutions like the monarchy in australia, the commemoration of anzac day and the design of the australian flag, but like keating he pursued privatisation of public utilities and the introduction of a broad based consumption tax (although keating had dropped support for a gst by the time of his 1993 election victory).
howard's premiership coincided with al qaeda's 11 september attacks on the united states.
in queensland, the liberal and national parties merged in 2008 to form the new liberal national party of queensland (registered as the queensland division of the liberal party of australia).
after the genpei war of the late 12th century, a clan leader minamoto no yoritomo obtained the right to appoint shugo and jito, and was allowed to organize soldiers and police, and to collect a certain amount of tax.
initially, their responsibility was restricted to arresting rebels and collecting needed army provisions, and they were forbidden from interfering with kokushi governors, but their responsibility gradually expanded and thus the samurai-class appeared as the political ruling power in japan.
their involvement in the hōgen in the late heian period consolidated their power, and finally pitted the rival minamoto and taira clans against each other in the heiji rebellion of 1160.
however, the taira clan was still very conservative when compared to its eventual successor, the minamoto, and instead of expanding or strengthening its military might, the clan had its women marry emperors and exercise control through the emperor.
the taira and the minamoto clashed again in 1180, beginning the gempei war, which ended in 1185.
completed in 1277, this wall stretched for 20 kilometers around the border of the bay.
perry used his superior firepower to force japan to open its borders to trade.
emperor meiji abolished the samurai's right to be the only armed force in favor of a more modern, western-style, conscripted army in 1873.
some of these exchange students started private schools for higher educations, while many samurai took pens instead of guns and became reporters and writers, setting up newspaper companies, and others entered governmental service.
the philosophies of buddhism and zen, and to a lesser extent confucianism and shinto, influenced the samurai culture.
the most defining role that confucianism played in samurai philosophy was to stress the importance of the lord-retainer relationship—the loyalty that a samurai was required to show his lord.
katō kiyomasa was one of the most powerful and well-known lords of the sengoku era.
with the heike monogatari, the image of the japanese warrior in literature came to its full maturity."
musō soseki (1275–1351) was a zen monk who was advisor to both emperor go-daigo and general ashikaga takauji (1304–58).
for example, the full name of oda nobunaga would be "oda kazusanosuke saburo nobunaga" (織田上総介三郎信長), in which "oda" is a clan or family name, "kazusanosuke" is a title of vice-governor of kazusa province, "saburo" is a formal nickname (yobina), and "nobunaga" is an adult name (nanori) given at genpuku, the coming of age ceremony.
kidnapping a concubine, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not criminal.
ideally, a samurai wife would be skilled at managing property, keeping records, dealing with financial matters, educating the children (and perhaps servants, too), and caring for elderly parents or in-laws that may be living under her roof.
marriage criteria began to weigh intelligence and education as desirable attributes in a wife, right along with physical attractiveness.

in the same war, the prussian edward schnell served the aizu domain as a military instructor and procurer of weapons.
the kozane were made from either iron or leather and were bound together into small strips, the strips were coated with lacquer to protect the kozane from water.
a series of strips of kozane were then laced together with silk or leather lace and formed into a complete chest armor (dou or dō).
the kozane dou made from individual scales was replaced by plate armor.
in 2007 the animated series debuted on american cable television on the spike tv channel (denison, 2010).
american comic books have adopted the character type for stories of their own like the mutant-villain silver samurai of marvel comics.
taking place during the meiji period, tom cruise plays the role of us army captain nathan algren, who travels to japan to train a rookie army in fighting off samurai rebel groups.
for example, if a problem in the requirements is found only post-release, then it would cost 10–100 times more to fix than if it had already been found by the requirements review.
black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, model-based testing, use case testing, exploratory testing and specification-based testing.
test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do.
these tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.
the tester is not required to have full access to the software's source code.[not in citation given] manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box, because the input and output are clearly outside of the "black box" that we are calling the system under test.
the main levels during the development process as defined by the swebok guide are unit-, integration-, and system testing that are distinguished by the test target without implying a specific process model.
this type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment.
a common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of its compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or gui application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a web application, which must render in a web browser).
for example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running.
for example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running.
common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test-cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged.
stability testing (often referred to as load or endurance testing) checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period.
volume testing is a way to test software functions even when certain components (for example a file or database) increase radically in size.
initially, in 1949, the states of the federal republic were baden, bavaria (in german: bayern), bremen, hamburg, hesse (hessen), lower saxony (niedersachsen), north rhine westphalia (nordrhein-westfalen), rhineland-palatinate (rheinland-pfalz), schleswig-holstein, württemberg-baden, and württemberg-hohenzollern.
but several proposals have failed so far; territorial reform remains a controversial topic in german politics and public perception.
the number of territories was greatly reduced during the napoleonic wars (1796–1814).
the empire was dominated by prussia, which controlled 65% of the territory and 62% of the population.
initially, only seven of the pre-war states remained: baden (in part), bavaria (reduced in size), bremen, hamburg, hesse (enlarged), saxony, and thuringia.
article 23, which had allowed "any other parts of germany" to join, was rephrased.
the amended article now defines the participation of the federal council and the 16 german states in matters concerning the european union.
the debate on a new delimitation of the german territory started in 1919 as part of discussions about the new constitution.
in the paris agreements of 23 october 1954, france offered to establish an independent "saarland", under the auspices of the western european union (weu), but on 23 october 1955 in the saar statute referendum the saar electorate rejected this plan by 67.7% to 32.3% (out of a 96.5% turnout: 423,434 against, 201,975 for) despite the public support of federal german chancellor konrad adenauer for the plan.

in his investiture address, given on 28 october 1969 in bonn, chancellor willy brandt proposed that the government would consider article 29 of the basic law as a binding order.
in the center and south west either rhineland-palatinate (with the exception of the germersheim district but including the rhine-neckar region) should be merged with hesse and the saarland (solution c), the district of germersheim would then become part of baden-württemberg.
the basic law of the federal republic of germany, the federal constitution, stipulates that the structure of each federal state's government must "conform to the principles of republican, democratic, and social government, based on the rule of law" (article 28).
most of the states are governed by a cabinet led by a ministerpräsident (minister-president), together with a unicameral legislative body known as the landtag (state diet).
before january 1, 2000, bavaria had a bicameral parliament, with a popularly elected landtag, and a senate made up of representatives of the state's major social and economic groups.
the parliament for berlin is called the abgeordnetenhaus (house of representatives), while bremen and hamburg both have a bürgerschaft.
such an organization requires the issuing of special laws by the governing state, since they are not covered by the normal administrative structure of the respective states.
under this broad statement of competence, local governments can justify a wide range of activities.
glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light.
thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses.[citation needed] iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared energy, for example in heat absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(iv) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs uv wavelengths.
the soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [cao], generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (mgo) and aluminium oxide (al2o3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability.
it has excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot.
however, its high melting-temperature (1723 °c) and viscosity make it difficult to work with.
ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(ii) oxide (feo) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments.
it was in the roman glassmaking center at trier, now in modern germany, that the late-latin term glesum originated, probably from a germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance.
optical glass for spectacles has been used since the late middle ages.
glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy systems.
the art nouveau movement made great use of glass, with rené lalique, émile gallé, and daum of nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using luster techniques.
from about 1960 onwards there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part fine arts.
the high ionic radius of the pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 ohm·cm, dc at 250 °c).
lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glasses.
the most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance.
evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating seo2.
at a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net cte near zero.
the reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above).
the light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle, as opposed to an electromagnetic wave.
in many cases, such as for monochromatic light or for atoms, this quantum of action also implies that only certain energy levels are allowed, and values in between are forbidden.
equivalently, the smallness of the planck constant reflects the fact that everyday objects and systems are made of a large number of particles.
in the last years of the nineteenth century, planck was investigating the problem of black-body radiation first posed by kirchhoff some forty years earlier.
the assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction: the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule, the stefan–boltzmann law (1879–84).
this kinetic energy (for each photoelectron) is independent of the intensity of the light, but depends linearly on the frequency; and if the frequency is too low (corresponding to a photon energy that is less than the work function of the material), no photoelectrons are emitted at all, unless a plurality of photons, whose energetic sum is greater than the energy of the photoelectrons, acts virtually simultaneously (multiphoton effect)  assuming the frequency is high enough to cause the photoelectric effect, a rise in intensity of the light source causes more photoelectrons to be emitted with the same kinetic energy, rather than the same number of photoelectrons to be emitted with higher kinetic energy.
niels bohr introduced the first quantized model of the atom in 1913, in an attempt to overcome a major shortcoming of rutherford's classical model.
the either-or nature of uncertainty forces measurement attempts to choose between trade offs, and given that they are quanta, the trade offs often take the form of either-or (as in fourier analysis), rather than the compromises and gray areas of time series analysis.
the bohr magneton and the nuclear magneton are units which are used to describe the magnetic properties of the electron and atomic nuclei respectively.
in principle, the planck constant could be determined by examining the spectrum of a black-body radiator or the kinetic energy of photoelectrons, and this is how its value was first calculated in the early twentieth century.
the theoretical difficulties arise from the fact that all of the methods except the x-ray crystal density method rely on the theoretical basis of the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect.
a watt balance is an instrument for comparing two powers, one of which is measured in si watts and the other of which is measured in conventional electrical units.
the most urgent unit on the list for redefinition is the kilogram, whose value has been fixed for all science (since 1889) by the mass of a small cylinder of platinum–iridium alloy kept in a vault just outside paris.

as of 2014, germany has a commitment to the "energiewende" transition to a sustainable energy economy, and denmark has a commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
based on ren21's 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
wind power accounts for approximately 19% of electricity generated in denmark, 9% in spain and portugal, and 6% in germany and the republic of ireland.
and the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in california helped to create the modern wind power industry.
second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time; they include solar heating, photovoltaics, wind power, solar thermal power stations, and modern forms of bioenergy.
the international solar energy society advocates "leveling the playing field" by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and r&d, in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support.
shifting these subsidies to the development of climate-benign energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth's climate."
some countries are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and belgium, france, and japan have phased out all subsidies for coal.
a number of events in 2006 pushed renewable energy up the political agenda, including the us mid-term elections in november, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue.
clean edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help countries around the world deal with the current economic malaise.
united nations' secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that "renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity".
mark z. jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and director of its atmosphere and energy program says producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050.
similarly, in the united states, the independent national research council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand." .
the tallest peak of the range is la pizzuta, about 1,333 m (4,373 ft.)
it became one of the three main phoenician colonies of sicily, along with motya and soluntum.
the kingdom of sicily became one of the wealthiest states in europe.
after the treaty of utrecht (1713), sicily was handed over to the savoia, but by 1734 it was again a bourbon possession.
the eastern edge of the walled city was on via roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of piazza marina.
the modern english word green comes from the middle english and anglo-saxon word grene, from the same germanic root as the words "grass" and "grow".
chlorophyll, the e numbers e140 and e141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials.
chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green.
substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.
there is no green pigment in green eyes; like the color of blue eyes, it is an optical illusion; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with the blue tone imparted by the rayleigh scattering of the reflected light.
in ancient egypt green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth, and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the nile.
the philosopher democritus described two different greens; cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green.
like other common colors, green has several completely opposite associations.
the largest green party in europe is alliance '90/the greens (german: bündnis 90/die grünen) in germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the german green party, founded in west germany in 1980, and alliance 90, founded during the revolution of 1989–1990 in east germany.
a variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.
zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish.
69mzn has the longest half-life, 13.76 h. the superscript m indicates a metastable isotope.
the [zn2]2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc(ii), and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten zncl2.
the galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for luigi galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.
smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals.
zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away.
alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings.
alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries.
another alloy, marketed under the brand name prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic.
because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide.
such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used.
zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers, twists and clusters.
the zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption.
plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease.
the zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, which is commonly fatal in dogs, where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia, and also liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms.
by the mid 18th century, the movement broadened to incorporate a greater range of classical influences, including those from ancient greece.
there was little to no direct knowledge of greek civilization before the middle of the 18th century in western europe, when an expedition funded by the society of dilettanti in 1751 and led by james stuart and nicholas revett began serious archaeological enquiry.
the first phase of neoclassicism in france is expressed in the "louis xvi style" of architects like ange-jacques gabriel (petit trianon, 1762–68); the second phase, in the styles called directoire and "empire", might be characterized by jean chalgrin's severe astylar arc de triomphe (designed in 1806).
in england the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of robert adam, the second by those of sir john soane.
the turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the ottoman empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences.
as such, the term serbo-croatian was first used by jacob grimm in 1824, popularized by the vienna philologist jernej kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by croatian zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859.
in the mid-19th century, serbian (led by self-taught writer and folklorist vuk stefanović karadžić) and most croatian writers and linguists (represented by the illyrian movement and led by ljudevit gaj and đuro daničić), proposed the use of the most widespread dialect, shtokavian, as the base for their common standard language.
all in all, this makes serbo-croatian the only slavic language to officially use both the latin and cyrillic scripts, albeit the latin version is more commonly used.
however, migrations from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of ottoman empire on the balkans have caused large-scale population displacement that broke the dialect continuum into many geographical pockets.
in the past, chakavian and kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by štokavian during the period of migrations caused by ottoman turkish conquest of the balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries.
daniel bunčić concludes that it is a pluricentric language, with four standard variants spoken in serbia, croatia, montenegro and bosnia and herzegovina.
however, croatian linguist snježana kordić has been leading an academic discussion on that issue in the croatian journal književna republika from 2001 to 2010.
this has been used as an argument to state that croatian literature croatian per se, but also includes serbian and other languages that are part of serbo-croatian, these facts undermine the croatian language proponents' argument that modern-day croatian is based on a language called old croatian.
the imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration.
for example, when short jat is preceded by r, in most ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. the prefix prě- ("trans-, over-") when long became pre- in eastern ijekavian dialects but to prije- in western dialects; in ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into pre- or prije- due to potential ambiguity with pri- ("approach, come close to").
in serbia, the serbian language is the official one, while both serbian and croatian are official in the province of vojvodina.
however, its nomenclature is controversial, as there is incentive that it is referred to as "bosniak" (bošnjački) rather than "bosnian" (bosanski) (see bosnian language for details).
under the cbc's current arrangement with rogers communications for national hockey league broadcast rights, hockey night in canada broadcasts on cbc-owned stations and affiliates are not technically aired over the cbc television network, but over a separate crtc-licensed part-time network operated by rogers.
other newscasts include parts of cbc news now airing weekday at 6:00 a.m. and noon.
during the nhl lockout and subsequent cancellation of the 2004-2005 hockey season, cbc instead aired various recent and classic movies, branded as movie night in canada, on saturday nights.
due to disappointing results and fan outrage over many draws being carried on cbc country canada (now called cottage life television, the association tried to cancel its multiyear deal with the cbc signed in 2004.
this later became a moot point, as the one was taken off the air after two weeks after extremely low american and canadian ratings, and the newscast resumed its regular schedule.
all cbc o&o stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are "cb" (an itu prefix allocated not to canada, but to chile) and the last letter is "t".
according to filings to the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission (crtc) by thunder bay electronics (owner of cbc's thunder bay affiliate ckpr-dt) and bell media (owner of cbc affiliates cftk-tv in terrace and cjdc-tv in dawson creek),[citation needed] the cbc informed them that it will not extend its association with any of its private affiliates beyond august 31, 2011.
as a result, there is now a giant hole in the coverage of cbc in south-western ontario.
at the transition deadline, barrie, ontario lost both cbc and radio-canada signals as the cbc did not request that the crtc allow these transmitters to continue operating.
at the transition deadline, barrie, ontario lost both cbc and radio-canada signals as the cbc did not request that the crtc allow these transmitters to continue operating.
according to the cbc, this would reduce the corporation's yearly costs by $10 million.
on march 23, 2011, the crtc rejected an application by the cbc to install a digital transmitter serving fredricton, new brunswick in place of the analogue transmitter serving fredericton and saint john, new brunswick, which would have served only 62.5% of the population served by the existing analogue transmitter.
the appalachian mountains (i/ˌæpəˈleɪʃᵻn/ or /ˌæpəˈlætʃᵻn/,[note 1] french: les appalaches), often called the appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern north america.
in pennsylvania, there are over sixty summits that rise over 2,500 ft (800 m); the summits of mount davis and blue knob rise over 3,000 ft (900 m).
before the french and indian war, the appalachian mountains laid on the indeterminate boundary between britain's colonies along the atlantic and french areas centered in the mississippi basin.
in eastern pennsylvania the great appalachian valley, or great valley, was accessible by reason of a broad gateway between the end of south mountain and the highlands, and many germans and moravians settled here between the susquehanna and delaware rivers forming the pennsylvania dutch community, some of whom even now speak a unique american dialect of german known as the "pennsylvania german language" or "pennsylvania dutch."
ibm has 12 research laboratories worldwide, bundled into ibm research.
over the past decade, it has steadily shifted its business mix by exiting commoditizing markets such as pcs, hard disk drives and drams and focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets such as business intelligence, data analytics, business continuity, security, cloud computing, virtualization and green solutions, resulting in a higher quality revenue stream and higher profit margins.
another three-day jam took place in 2004, with 52,000 employees discussing ways to implement company values in practice.
in 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to chinese technology company lenovo, and in the same year it agreed to acquire micromuse.
on january 21, 2014 ibm announced that company executives would forgo bonuses for fiscal year 2013.
in 1924 the quarter century club, which recognizes employees with 25 years of service, was organized and the first issue of business machines, ibm's internal publication, was published.
in 1932 ibm created an education department to oversee training for employees, which oversaw the completion of the ibm schoolhouse at endicott in 1933.
in 1942, ibm launched a program to train and employ disabled people in topeka, kansas.
the following year, ibm hosted its first invention award dinner honoring 34 outstanding ibm inventors; and in 1963, the company named the first eight ibm fellows in a new fellowship program that recognizes senior ibm scientists, engineers and other professionals for outstanding technical achievements.
the company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on linux through the ibm linux technology center, which includes over 300 linux kernel developers.
it is going to be used for several tasks like: word processing, presentations, along with collaboration with lotus notes, instant messaging and blog tools as well as an internet explorer competitor – the mozilla firefox web browser.
this creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the available energy.
examples of energy transformation include generating electric energy from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor.
for example, classical mechanics distinguishes between kinetic energy, which is determined by an object's movement through space, and potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object within a field.
in human terms, the human equivalent (h-e) (human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kj per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts.
an example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.
this meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion.
the direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations.
as the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder).
the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system.
this is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time.
this mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval.
virtual photons (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in coulomb law), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the casimir force, for van der waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena.
because the duchy was outside of the core holy roman empire, the prince-electors of brandenburg were able to proclaim themselves king of prussia beginning in 1701.
after the disastrous defeat of the prussian army at the battle of jena-auerstedt in 1806, napoleon occupied berlin and had the officials of the prussian general directory swear an oath of allegiance to him, while king frederick william iii and his consort louise fled via königsberg and the curonian spit to memel.
parts of it were transferred to other regions, e.g. suwałki to regierungsbezirk gumbinnen and soldau to regierungsbezirk allenstein.
the largest camp with about 48,000 inmates was established at deutsch eylau (iława).
german names have been revived in commercial russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting kaliningrad's name to its historic name of königsberg.

after conquests in the balkans by murad i between 1362 and 1389, the ottoman sultanate was transformed into a transcontinental empire and claimant to the caliphate.
during the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of suleiman the magnificent, the ottoman empire was a multinational, multilingual empire controlling much of southeast europe, western asia, the caucasus, north africa, and the horn of africa.
with constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the mediterranean basin, the ottoman empire was at the centre of interactions between the eastern and western worlds for six centuries.
the empire allied with germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, joining in world war i to achieve this ambition on the side of germany and the central powers.
the word ottoman is a historical anglicisation of the name of osman i, the founder of the empire and of the ruling house of osman (also known as the ottoman dynasty).
after further advances by the turks, the habsburg ruler ferdinand officially recognized ottoman ascendancy in hungary in 1547.
the portuguese discovery of the cape of good hope in 1488 initiated a series of ottoman-portuguese naval wars in the indian ocean throughout the 16th century.
the ottoman navy recovered quickly, persuading venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573, allowing the ottomans to expand and consolidate their position in north africa.
during his brief majority reign, murad iv (1612–1640) reasserted central authority and recaptured iraq (1639) from the safavids.
in 1768 russian-backed ukrainian haidamaks, pursuing polish confederates, entered balta, an ottoman-controlled town on the border of bessarabia in ukraine, and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground.
the treaty of küçük kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the christian citizens of the ottoman-controlled provinces of wallachia and moldavia.
in 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic greeks.
by 1881, the ottoman empire agreed to have its debt controlled by an institution known as the ottoman public debt administration, a council of european men with presidency alternating between france and britain.
the ottoman bashi-bazouks brutally suppressed the bulgarian uprising of 1876, massacring up to 100,000 people in the process.
profiting from the civil strife, austria-hungary officially annexed bosnia and herzegovina in 1908.
these court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive: for instance, the islamic courts—which were the empire's primary courts—could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and jews and christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue.
presiding over islamic courts would be a qadi, or judge.
the ottoman turks began using falconets, which were short but wide cannons, during the siege of constantinople.
in may 1913 the world's first specialized reconnaissance training program was started by the aviation school and the first separate reconnaissance division was established.[citation needed] in june 1914 a new military academy, the naval aviation school (bahriye tayyare mektebi) was founded.
the ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the middle east in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous.
modern ottoman studies think that the change in relations between the ottoman turks and central europe was caused by the opening of the new sea routes.
it is possible to see the decline in the significance of the land routes to the east as western europe opened the ocean routes that bypassed the middle east and mediterranean as parallel to the decline of the ottoman empire itself.
these people are called muhacir.
by the time the ottoman empire came to an end in 1922, half of the urban population of turkey was descended from muslim refugees from russia.
a large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (سجع, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the arabic saj' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme.
it was a part of the ottoman book arts together with the ottoman miniature (taswir), calligraphy (hat), islamic calligraphy, bookbinding (cilt) and paper marbling (ebru).
ottoman classical music was an important part of the education of the ottoman elite, a number of the ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as selim iii, whose compositions are often still performed today.
because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the ottoman empire: ottoman classical music, and folk music.
some of the distinctive styles were: janissary music, roma music, belly dance, turkish folk music.
much of the cuisine of former ottoman territories today is descended from a shared ottoman cuisine, especially turkish cuisine, and including greek cuisine, balkan cuisine, armenian cuisine, and middle eastern cuisine.
without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."
arguing against the absolutist position, leibniz offers a number of thought experiments with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity.
but if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating.
the symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects.
the formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations.
an eternalist, on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things—past, present, and future—can be said to be just as real as things in the present.
however, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid.
this asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling.
traditionally considered the last part of the stone age, the neolithic followed the terminal holocene epipaleolithic period and commenced with the beginning of farming, which produced the "neolithic revolution".
in other parts of the world, such as africa, south asia and southeast asia, independent domestication events led to their own regionally distinctive neolithic cultures that arose completely independent of those in europe and southwest asia.
a temple area in southeastern turkey at göbekli tepe dated around 9,500 bc may be regarded as the beginning of the period.
this site was developed by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, evidenced by the lack of permanent housing in the vicinity and may be the oldest known human-made place of worship.
these cultures are usually not referred to as belonging to the neolithic; in america different terms are used such as formative stage instead of mid-late neolithic, archaic era instead of early neolithic and paleo-indian for the preceding period.
however, most neolithic societies were noticeably more hierarchical than the paleolithic cultures that preceded them and hunter-gatherer cultures in general.
the domestication of large animals (c. 8000 bc) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred; new guinea being a notable exception.
there is a large body of evidence for fortified settlements at linearbandkeramik sites along the rhine, as at least some villages were fortified for some time with a palisade and an outer ditch.
settlements with palisades and weapon-traumatized bones have been discovered, such as at the talheim death pit demonstrates "...systematic violence between groups" and warfare was probably much more common during the neolithic than in the preceding paleolithic period.
these tombs are particularly numerous in ireland, where there are many thousand still in existence.
he was a medical doctor employed by the municipal ministry of health, with passion in botany, in which he wrote a number of monographs.
hayek was the oldest of three brothers, heinrich (1900–69) and erich (1904–86), who were one-and-a-half and five years younger than him.
friedrich's paternal grandfather, gustav edler von hayek, taught natural sciences at the imperial realobergymnasium (secondary school) in vienna.
between 1923 and 1924 hayek worked as a research assistant to prof. jeremiah jenks of new york university, compiling macroeconomic data on the american economy and the operations of the us federal reserve.
upon his arrival in london, hayek was quickly recognised as one of the leading economic theorists in the world, and his development of the economics of processes in time and the co-ordination function of prices inspired the ground-breaking work of john hicks, abba lerner, and many others in the development of modern microeconomics.
in 1950, hayek left the london school of economics for the university of chicago, where he became a professor in the committee on social thought.
hayek, frank knight, friedman and george stigler worked together in forming the mont pèlerin society, an international forum for libertarian economists.
after editing a book on john stuart mill's letters he planned to publish two books on the liberal order, the constitution of liberty and "the creative powers of a free civilization" (eventually the title for the second chapter of the constitution of liberty).
hayek was disappointed that the book did not receive the same enthusiastic general reception as the road to serfdom had sixteen years before.
hayek was criticised by liberal politicians gladwyn jebb and andrew phillips, who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation.
in 1984, he was appointed as a member of the order of the companions of honour (ch) by queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom on the advice of the british prime minister margaret thatcher for his "services to the study of economics".
this argument, first proposed by max weber, says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the price mechanism in free markets (see economic calculation problem).
hayek's work on the microeconomics of the choice theoretics of investment, non-permanent goods, potential permanent resources, and economically-adapted permanent resources mark a central dividing point between his work in areas of macroeconomics and that of almost all other economists.
summarizing on this topic, wapshott writes "[hayek] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance, enforced, if not directly provided, by the state."
my personal impression – and this is valid for south america – is that in chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government."
the nearly decade long deflationary depression in britain dating from churchill's decision in 1925 to return britain to the gold standard at the old pre-war, pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for hayek's single public engagement with keynes over british monetary and fiscal policy, otherwise hayek and keynes agreed on many theoretical matters, and their economic disagreements were fundamentally theoretical, having to do almost exclusively with the relation of the economics of extending the length of production to the economics of labour inputs.
for his part, hayek dedicated a collection of papers, studies in philosophy, politics, and economics, to popper and, in 1982, said that "ever since his logik der forschung first came out in 1934, i have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology".
likewise, david stockman, ronald reagan's most influential financial official in 1981 was an acknowledged follower of hayek.
the most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.
if blood is present it is also known as dysentery.
about 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year.
it can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.[citation needed]
early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults," and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition.
another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months.
in the west, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied.
the madaris also resemble colleges, where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories.
the curriculum of a madrasah was usually set by its founder, but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences.
george makdisi considers the ijāzah to be the origin of the european doctorate.
al-qarawīyīn university in fez, morocco is recognised by many historians as the oldest degree-granting university in the world, having been founded in 859 by fatima al-fihri.
al-azhar university, founded in cairo, egypt in 975 by the ismaʻīlī shīʻī fatimid dynasty as a jāmiʻah, had individual faculties for a theological seminary, islamic law and jurisprudence, arabic grammar, islamic astronomy, early islamic philosophy and logic in islamic philosophy.
the madrasa of al-qarawīyīn, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the "first universities" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947.
makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which can be traced back to their roots in islamic education.
generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on "the accumulation of close parallels", but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the muslim and christian world.
however, al-sakhawi and mohammad akram nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century.
al-sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary al-ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.
i̇nalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of islam."
social life was not dominated by religion only in the muslim world of the ottoman empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of europe during this period.
they tried moving their developing state toward islamic orthodoxy."
some notable establishments include: al jamiatul ashrafia, mubarakpur, manzar islam bareilly, jamia nizamdina new delhi, jamia nayeemia muradabad which is one of the largest learning centres for the barelvis.
there are six madrasahs in singapore, catering to students from primary 1 to secondary 4.
the deped adopted department order no.
some madaris in india, for example, have a secularised identity.

philadelphia played an instrumental role in the american revolution as a meeting place for the founding fathers of the united states, who signed the declaration of independence in 1776 and the constitution in 1787.
philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the revolutionary war, and served as temporary u.s. capital while washington, d.c., was under construction.
as a result, the economic base of philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined significantly.
the city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s.
the lenape are a native american tribe and first nations band government.
lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with europeans.
these immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in north america in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday.
philadelphia's central city was created in the 17th century following the plan by william penn's surveyor thomas holme.

he graduated from yale university class of 1966 with a political science major.
he also became a member of the secretive skull and bones society, and traveled to switzerland through aiesec yale.
during his tour on the guided missile frigate uss gridley, kerry requested duty in south vietnam, listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a fast patrol craft (pcf), also known as a "swift boat."
kerry's commanding officer, lieutenant commander george elliott, stated to douglas brinkley in 2003 that he did not know whether to court-martial kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew.
the engagement was documented in an after-action report, a press release written on march 1, 1969, and a historical summary dated march 17, 1969.
with the continuing controversy that had surrounded the military service of george w. bush since the 2000 presidential election (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the texas air national guard, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the united states army, and possible service in the vietnam war), john kerry's contrasting status as a decorated vietnam war veteran posed a problem for bush's re-election campaign, which republicans sought to counter by calling kerry's war record into question.
kerry participated in the "winter soldier investigation" conducted by vvaw of u.s. atrocities in vietnam, and he appears in a film by that name that documents the investigation.
kerry was arrested on may 30, 1971, during a vvaw march to honor american pows held captive by north vietnam.
in 1970, kerry had considered running for congress in the democratic primary against hawkish democrat philip j. philbin of massachusetts's 3rd congressional district, but deferred in favour of robert drinan, a jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat philbin.
in the general election, kerry was initially favored to defeat the republican candidate, former state representative paul w. cronin, and conservative democrat roger p. durkin, who ran as an independent.
in the final days of the campaign, kerry sensed that it was "slipping away" and cronin emerged victorious by 110,970 votes (53.45%) to kerry's 92,847 (44.72%).
he spent some time working as a fundraiser for the cooperative for assistance and relief everywhere (care), an international humanitarian organization.
congressman james shannon, a favorite of house speaker tip o'neill, was the early favorite to win the nomination, and he "won broad establishment support and led in early polling."

on april 18, 1985, a few months after taking his senate seat, kerry and senator tom harkin of iowa traveled to nicaragua and met the country's president, daniel ortega.
the kerry committee report found that "the contra drug links included..... payments to drug traffickers by the u.s. state department of funds authorized by the congress for humanitarian assistance to the contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."
he also said that from the context of the speech which, prior to the "stuck in iraq" line, made several specific references to bush and elements of his biography, that kerry was referring to president bush and not american troops in general.
in the 2004 democratic presidential primaries, john kerry defeated several democratic rivals, including sen. john edwards (d-north carolina.),
during his bid to be elected president in 2004, kerry frequently criticized president george w. bush for the iraq war.
his statement on march 16, 2004, "i actually did vote for the $87 billion before i voted against it," helped the bush campaign to paint him as a flip-flopper and has been cited as contributing to kerry's defeat.
in the state department, kerry quickly earned a reputation "for being aloof, keeping to himself, and not bothering to read staff memos."
in a speech before the organization of american states in november 2013, kerry remarked that the era of the monroe doctrine was over.
kerry's paternal grandparents, shoe businessman frederick a. "fred" kerry and musician ida lowe, were immigrants from the austro-hungarian empire.
however, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 billion, according to a study in the los angeles times.
forbes magazine (named for the forbes family of publishers, unrelated to kerry) estimated that if elected, and if heinz family assets were included, kerry would have been the third-richest u.s. president in history, when adjusted for inflation.
he said that he believed that the torah, the qur'an, and the bible all share a fundamental story which connects with readers.
in addition to the sports he played at yale, kerry is described by sports illustrated, among others, as an "avid cyclist", primarily riding on a road bike.
according to the boston herald, dated july 23, 2010, kerry commissioned construction on a new $7 million yacht (a friendship 75) in new zealand and moored it in portsmouth, rhode island, where the friendship yacht company is based.
the first mention of the name "rajasthan" appears in james tod's 1829 publication annals and antiquities of rajast'han or the central and western rajpoot states of india, while the earliest known record of "rajputana" as a name for the region is in george thomas's 1800 memoir military memories.
bhils once ruled kota.
bharatpur and dholpur were jat princely states whereas tonk was a princely state under a muslim nawab.
about three-fifths of rajasthan lies northwest of the aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.
most of this region are covered by the thar desert which extends into adjoining portions of pakistan.
the aravalli range runs across the state from the southwest peak guru shikhar (mount abu), which is 1,722 m in height, to khetri in the northeast.
rajasthan is among the largest producers of edible oils in india and the second largest producer of oilseeds.
other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori mirchi bada, pyaaj kachori and ghevar from jodhpur, alwar ka mawa(milk cake), malpauas from pushkar and rassgollas from bikaner.
originating from the marwar region of the state is the concept marwari bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of india, which offer vegetarian food of the marwari people.
although rajasthan's literacy rate is below the national average of 74.04% and although its female literacy rate is the lowest in the country, the state has been praised for its efforts and achievements in raising male and female literacy rates.
the chamorros, guam's indigenous people, settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago.
these outrigger canoes were called proas, and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas ("islands of the lateen sails").
despite magellan's visit, guam was not officially claimed by spain until january 26, 1565 by general miguel lópez de legazpi.:46 from 1565 to 1815, guam and the northern mariana islands, the only spanish outpost in the pacific ocean east of the philippines, was an important resting stop for the manila galleons, a fleet that covered the pacific trade route between acapulco and manila.:51 to protect these pacific fleets, spain built several defensive structures which are still standing today, such as fort nuestra señora de la soledad in umatac.
however, due to its proximity to anatahan, vog (i.e. volcanic smog) does occasionally affect guam.
guam's climate is characterized as tropical marine moderated by seasonal northeast trade winds.
the mean high temperature is 86 °f (30 °c) and mean low is 76 °f (24 °c) with an average annual rainfall of 96 inches (2,180 mm).
the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation.
the u.s. military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on guam and moving 8,600 marines, and 9,000 of their dependents, to guam from okinawa, japan.
its tourist hub, tumon, features over 20 large hotels, a duty free shoppers galleria, pleasure island district, indoor aquarium, sandcastle las vegas–styled shows and other shopping and entertainment venues.
it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based shipping line matson, inc. whose container ships connect guam with honolulu, hawaii, los angeles, california, oakland, california and seattle, washington.
as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction.
crb is native to southern asia and distributed throughout asia and the western pacific including sri lanka, upolu, samoa, american samoa, palau, new britain, west irian, new ireland, pak island and manus island (new guinea), fiji, cocos (keeling) islands, mauritius, and reunion.
efforts have been made to protect guam's coral reef habitats from pollution, eroded silt and overfishing, problems that have led to decreased fish populations. (
the government of guam maintains the island's main health care facility, guam memorial hospital, in tamuning.
for example, john locke held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of god's existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone.
the main continental rationalists (descartes, spinoza, and leibniz) were also advocates of the empirical "scientific method".
during the middle ages aristotle's theory of tabula rasa was developed by islamic philosophers starting with al farabi, developing into an elaborate theory by avicenna and demonstrated as a thought experiment by ibn tufail.
so the immaterial "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.
in the 12th century ce the andalusian muslim philosopher and novelist abu bakr ibn tufail (known as "abubacer" or "ebn tophail" in the west) included the theory of tabula rasa as a thought experiment in his arabic philosophical novel, hayy ibn yaqdhan in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child "from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a desert island, through experience alone.
their contemporary, leonardo da vinci (1452–1519) said, "if you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings."
in the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way.
locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a "blank tablet", in locke's words "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written.
the scottish philosopher david hume (1711–1776) responded to berkeley's criticisms of locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism.
hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: relations of ideas and matters of fact (see also kant's analytic-synthetic distinction).
all of people's "ideas", in turn, are derived from their "impressions".
it fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.
the phenomenalist phase of post-humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.
logical empiricism (also logical positivism or neopositivism) was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of british empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from mathematical logic that had been developed by gottlob frege and ludwig wittgenstein.
this notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research, most recently for instance with the work of irvin rock on indirect perception.
john dewey (1859–1952) modified james' pragmatism to form a theory known as instrumentalism.
epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing.
arne grøn calls this doctrine "the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a transcendent idealism", while simone klein calls plato "the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism".
similarly, in regard to passages from the enneads, "the only space or place of the world is the soul" and "time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul", ludwig noiré wrote: "for the first time in western philosophy we find idealism proper in plotinus, however, plotinus does not address whether we know external objects, unlike schopenhauer and other modern philosophers.
and proliferation of hyphenated entities such as "thing-in-itself" (immanuel kant), "things-as-interacted-by-us" (arthur fine), "table-of-commonsense" and "table-of-physics" (sir arthur eddington) which are "warning signs" for conceptual idealism according to musgrave because they allegedly do not exist but only highlight the numerous ways in which people come to know the world.
the 2nd edition (1787) contained a refutation of idealism to distinguish his transcendental idealism from descartes's sceptical idealism and berkeley's anti-realist strain of subjective idealism.
hegel called his philosophy "absolute" idealism in contrast to the "subjective idealism" of berkeley and the "transcendental idealism" of kant and fichte, which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as hegel's idealism was.
under hegel's concept of "subject-object identity," subject and object both have spirit (hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural "god") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical.
individual human will ought, at the state's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the state.
thomas davidson taught a philosophy called "apeirotheism", a "form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism" which he defined as "a theory of gods infinite in number."
"the mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds.... the mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it.... it is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness.... consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature.... it is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character.

one study showed that czech and slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation; slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, praha becomes praze in czech and prahe in slovak).
according to legend they were led by a hero named čech, from whom the word "czech" derives.
they also brought the glagolitic alphabet to the west slavs, whose language was previously unwritten.
its use of cases differed from the modern language; although old czech did not yet have a vocative case or an animacy distinction, declension for its six cases and three genders rapidly became complicated (partially to differentiate homophones) and its declension patterns resembled those of lithuanian (its balto-slavic cousin).
economist jonathan van parys collected data on language knowledge in europe for the 2012 european day of languages.
vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed.
as a pro-drop language, in czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb.
pavla is in the accusative case, the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb.
in czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases.
czech distinguishes three genders—masculine, feminine, and neuter—and the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate.
the verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix.
the infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti).
its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet.
secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years.
secondary education in the united states did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers.
higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school.
informal learning usually takes place outside educational establishments, does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing practical requirements.
autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is a contemplative, absorbing process, of "learning on your own" or "by yourself", or as a self-teacher.
one may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life.
in 2012, the modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning.[clarification needed] open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods.
the conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the open university in the united kingdom.
universal primary education is one of the eight international millennium development goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.
additionally, transparency international has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving universal primary education in africa.
similarities — in systems or even in ideas — that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges.
the european socrates-erasmus program facilitates exchanges across european universities.
people in developed countries have the will and the way to do many things that they want to do.
educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines.
tennessee is bordered by kentucky and virginia to the north, north carolina to the east, georgia, alabama, and mississippi to the south, and arkansas and missouri to the west.
tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of american popular music, including rock and roll, blues, country, and rockabilly.[not verified in body] beale street in memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues, with musicians such as w.c. handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909.[not verified in body] memphis is also home to sun records, where musicians such as elvis presley, johnny cash, carl perkins, jerry lee lewis, roy orbison, and charlie rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s.[not verified in body] the 1927 victor recording sessions in bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the grand ole opry in the 1930s helped make nashville the center of the country music recording industry.[not verified in body] three brick-and-mortar museums recognize tennessee's role in nurturing various forms of popular music: the memphis rock n' soul museum, the country music hall of fame and museum in nashville, and the international rock-a-billy museum in jackson.
this explanation is more likely, because president polk's call for 2,600 nationwide volunteers at the beginning of the mexican-american war resulted in 30,000 volunteers from tennessee alone, largely in response to the death of davy crockett and appeals by former tennessee governor and now texas politician, sam houston.

the first british settlement in what is now tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of south carolina at fort loudoun, near present-day vonore.
the trace was called the "north carolina road" or "avery's trace", and sometimes "the wilderness road" (although it should not be confused with daniel boone's "wilderness road" through the cumberland gap).
the capture of memphis and nashville gave the union control of the western and middle sections; this control was confirmed at the battle of murfreesboro in early january 1863 and by the subsequent tullahoma campaign.
the confederates besieged chattanooga during the chattanooga campaign in early fall 1863, but were driven off by grant in november.
because tennessee had ratified the fourteenth amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the reconstruction period.
over the next decade, the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control african americans.

the term "post-punk" was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk's sonic template into disparate areas.
many of these artists, initially inspired by punk's diy ethic and energy, ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement, feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula, rock convention and self-parody.
artists moved beyonds punk's focus on the concerns of a largely white, male, working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes, such as three-chord progressions and chuck berry-based guitar riffs.
though the music varied widely between regions and artists, the post-punk movement has been characterized by its "conceptual assault" on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist, hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub, electronic music, disco, noise, jazz, krautrock, world music and the avant-garde.
nicholas lezard described post-punk as "a fusion of art and music".
among major influences on a variety of post-punk artists were writers such as william s. burroughs and j.g. ballard, avant-garde political scenes such as situationism and dada, and intellectual movements such as postmodernism.
while some critics, such as allmusic's stephen thomas erlewine, have employed the term "post-punk" to denote "a more adventurous and arty form of punk", others have suggested it pertains to a set of artistic sensibilities and approaches rather than any unifying style.
nicholas lezard, problematizing the categorization of post-punk as a genre, described the movement as "so multifarious that only the broadest use of the term is possible".
additionally, the accuracy of the term's chronological prefix "post" has been disputed, as various groups commonly labeled post-punk in fact predate the punk rock movement.
by 1977, groups began pointedly pursuing methods of releasing music independently , an idea disseminated in particular by the buzzcocks' release of their spiral scratch ep on their own label as well as the self-released 1977 singles of desperate bicycles.
these diy imperatives would help form the production and distribution infrastructure of post-punk and the indie music scene that later blossomed in the mid-1980s.
in late 1977, music writers for sounds first used the terms "new musick" and "post punk" to describe british acts such as siouxsie and the banshees and wire, who began experimenting with sounds, lyrics and aesthetics that differed significantly from their punk contemporaries.
as the initial punk movement dwindled, vibrant new scenes began to coalesce out of a variety of bands pursuing experimental sounds and wider conceptual territory in their work.
many of these artists drew on backgrounds in art and viewed their music as invested in particular political or aesthetic agendas.

weeks after ending the sex pistols, lydon formed the experimental group public image ltd and declared the project to be "anti music of any kind".
a variety of subsequent groups, including new york-based talking heads and boston-based mission of burma, combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities.
san francisco's vibrant post-punk scene was centered around such groups as chrome, the residents and tuxedomoon, who incorporated multimedia experimentation, film and ideas from antonin artaud's theater of cruelty.
the network of supportive record labels that included industrial, fast, e.g., mute, axis/4ad and glass continued to facilitate a large output of music, by artists such as the raincoats, essential logic, killing joke, the teardrop explodes, and the psychedelic furs.
in the music press, the increasingly esoteric writing of post-punk publications soon began to alienate their readerships; it is estimated that within several years, nme suffered the loss of half its circulation.
these new developments, in which post-punk artists attempted to bring subversive ideas into the pop mainstream, began to be categorized under the marketing term new pop.
in the early 1980s, downtown manhattan's no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound, with compilations such as ze's mutant disco (1981) highlighting a newly playful sensibility borne out of the city's clash of hip hop, disco and punk styles, as well as dub reggae and world music influences.

in germany, groups such as einstürzende neubauten developed a unique style of industrial music, utilizing avant-garde noise, homemade instruments and found objects.
in brazil, the post-punk scene grew after the generation of brasilia rock with bands such as legião urbana, capital inicial and plebe rude and then the opening of the music club madame satã in são paulo, with acts like cabine c, titãs, patife band, fellini and mercenárias, as documented on compilations like the sexual life of the savages and the não wave/não são paulo series, released in the uk, germany and brazil, respectively.[citation needed]
contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary, asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own.
bands such as joy division, siouxsie and the banshees, bauhaus and the cure played in a darker, more morose style of post-punk that lead to the development of the gothic rock genre.
post-punk was an eclectic genre which resulted in a wide variety of musical innovations and helped merge white and black musical styles.
in the 2010s, savages played a music reminiscent of early british post-punk bands of the late '70s.
additionally, some darker post-punk bands began to appear in the indie music scene in the 2010s, including cold cave, she wants revenge, eagulls, the soft moon, she past away and light asylum, who were also affiliated with the darkwave revival, as well as a place to bury strangers, who combined early post-punk and shoegaze.
the burnside rules closely resembling american football that were incorporated in 1903 by the orfu, was an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game.
the grey cup was established in 1909 after being donated by albert grey, 4th earl grey, the governor general of canada as the championship of teams under the cru for the rugby football championship of canada.
the captain of the team winning the coin toss is given the option of having first choice, or of deferring first choice to the other captain.
during the last three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place the ball in play within the 20-second play clock, known as "time count" (this foul is known as "delay of game" in american football), is dramatically different from during the first 27 minutes.
a coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and advances through a series of downs until it scores or loses possession.
because of prussia's alliance with britain, austria formed an alliance with france, seeing an opportunity to recapture silesia, which had been lost in a previous war.
sweden, fearing prussia's expansionist tendencies, went to war in 1757 to protect its baltic dominions, seeing its chance when virtually all of europe opposed prussia.
the taxation needed for war caused the russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by empress elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the winter palace.
the hanoverian king george ii of great britain was passionately devoted to his family’s continental holdings, but his commitments in germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the british colonies overseas.
if war against france for colonial expansion was to be resumed, then hanover had to be secured against franco-prussian attack.
louis’s goals for le secret du roi included an attempt to win the polish crown for his kinsman louis françois de bourbon, prince de conti, and the maintenance of poland, sweden, and turkey as french client states in opposition to russian and austrian interests.
if he joined the french against the british in the hope of annexing hanover, he might fall victim to an austro-russian attack.
britain's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect hanover's interests against france.
on january 16, 1756, the convention of westminster was signed wherein britain and prussia promised to aid one another in order to achieve lasting peace and stability in europe.
on september 30, 1755, britain pledged financial aid to russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the livonian-lithunian border, so they could defend britain's interests in hanover immediately.
thereafter, on may 1, 1756, the first treaty of versailles was signed, in which both nations pledged 24.000 troops to defend each other in the case of an attack.
the most important french fort planned was intended to occupy a position at "the forks" where the allegheny and monongahela rivers meet to form the ohio river (present day pittsburgh, pennsylvania).
similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any french ruler.
this approach did not serve france well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, but although much of the european war went well, by its end france had few counterbalancing european successes.
in the seven years' war, the british chose as their principal partner the greatest general of the day, frederick the great of prussia, then the rising power in central europe, and paid frederick substantial subsidies for his campaigns.:106 this was accomplished in the diplomatic revolution of 1756, in which britain ended its long-standing alliance with austria in favor of prussia, leaving austria to side with france.
first, he would seize saxony and eliminate it as a threat to prussia, then using the saxon army and treasury to aid the prussian war effort.
on the right was a column of about 15,000 men under the command of prince ferdinand of brunswick.
on the left was a column of 18,000 men under the command of the duke of brunswick-bevern.
at the battle of lobositz on 1 october 1756, frederick prevented the isolated saxon army from being reinforced by an austrian army under general browne.
britain had been surprised by the sudden prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and ₤670,000 (equivalent to ₤89.9 million in 2015) to its new ally.
after winning the bloody battle of prague on 6 may 1757, in which both forces suffered major casualties, the prussians forced the austrians back into the fortifications of prague.
this problem was compounded when the main hanoverian army under cumberland was defeated at the battle of hastenbeck and forced to surrender entirely at the convention of klosterzeven following a french invasion of hanover.
the convention removed hanover and brunswick from the war, leaving the western approach to prussian territory extremely vulnerable.
when the prussian king frederick was marching south with his powerful armies, the hungarian general unexpectedly swung his force of 5,000, mostly hussars, around the prussians and occupied part of their capital, berlin, for one night.
the city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers.
ferdinand had succeeded in driving the french from hanover and westphalia and re-captured the port of emden in march 1758 before crossing the rhine with his own forces, which caused alarm in france.
the russians under general saltykov and austrians under general lacy briefly occupied his capital, berlin, in october, but could not hold it for long.
eventually the anglo-portuguese army, aided by guerrillas and practicing a scorched earth strategy, chased the greatly reduced franco-spanish army back to spain, recovering almost all the lost towns, among them the spanish headquarters in castelo branco full of wounded and sick that had been left behind.
british subsidies had been stopped by the new prime minister lord bute, and the russian emperor had been overthrown by his wife, catherine, who ended russia's alliance with prussia and withdrew from the war.
the latter victory was marred when france's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating british column, which was under french guard, slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men, women and children while the french refused to protect their captives.
all of britain's campaigns against new france succeeded in 1759, part of what became known as an annus mirabilis.
the exchanges suited the british as well, as their own caribbean islands already supplied ample sugar, and, with the acquisition of new france and florida, they now controlled all of north america east of the mississippi.
the treaty of hubertusburg, between austria, prussia, and saxony, was signed on february 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between dresden and leipzig.
the austrians wanted at least to retain glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but frederick would not allow it.
the quebec act of 1774, similarly intended to win over the loyalty of french canadians, also spurred resentment among american colonists.
consequently, when the american war of independence turned into a global war between 1778–83, britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of european powers, and lacking any substantial ally.

feynman attended far rockaway high school, a school in far rockaway, queens also attended by fellow nobel laureates burton richter and baruch samuel blumberg.
he attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to princeton university in mathematics and physics—an unprecedented feat—but did rather poorly on the history and english portions.
due to the top secret nature of the work, los alamos was isolated.
in the same lecture, he further explained that antiparticles must exist, for if particles had only positive energies, they would not be restricted to a so-called "light cone".
he routinely refused to be included in lists or books that classified people by race.
one co-worker characterized feynman as akin to don quixote at his desk, rather than at a computer workstation, ready to do battle with the windmills.

ruling by decree, the rcc maintained the monarchy's ban on political parties, in may 1970 banned trade unions, and in 1972 outlawed workers' strikes and suspended newspapers.
with crude oil as the country's primary export, gaddafi sought to improve libya's oil sector.
the rcc followed with the tripoli agreement, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.
increasing state control over the oil sector, the rcc began a program of nationalization, starting with the expropriation of british petroleum's share of the british petroleum-n.b. hunt sahir field in december 1971.
in turn, the libyans' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of gaddafi's administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like italy and the u.k.
the rcc attempted to suppress regional and tribal affiliation, replacing it with a unified pan-libyan identity.
in doing so, they tried discrediting tribal leaders as agents of the old regime, and in august 1971 a sabha military court tried many of them for counter-revolutionary activity.
after nasser died in november 1970, his successor, anwar sadat, suggested that rather than a unified state, they create a political federation, implemented in april 1971; in doing so, egypt, syria and sudan got large grants of libyan oil money.
orchestrating a military build-up, the rcc began purchasing weapons from france and the soviet union.
in june 1973, gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the popular revolution.

in september, gaddafi called for the people's committees to eliminate the "bureaucracy of the public sector" and the "dictatorship of the private sector"; the people's committees took control of several hundred companies, converting them into worker cooperatives run by elected representatives.
publishing a weekly magazine the green march (al-zahf al-akhdar), in october 1980 they took control of the press.
in 1979, the committees began the redistribution of land in the jefara plain, continuing through 1981.
the following year, the gpc announced that the government would take control of all import, export and distribution functions, with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods and the development of a thriving black market.
the early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion.
in october 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalised army initiated a failed coup in misrata, while in september 1995, islamists launched an insurgency in benghazi, and in july 1996 an anti-gaddafist football riot broke out in tripoli.
in june 1999, gaddafi visited mandela in south africa, and the following month attended the oau summit in algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a united states of africa.
they proved ineffective, and on 17 february 2011, major protests broke out against gaddafi's government.
on 26 february the united nations security council passed resolution 1970, suspending libya from the un human rights council, implementing sanctions and calling for an international criminal court (icc) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians.
ignoring this, qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with france and the united arab emirates provided the ntc with weaponry and training.

his opposition to western governments earned him the respect of many in the euro-american far right.
opponents were critical of libya's human rights abuses; according to human rights watch (hrw) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the abu salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 june 1996 in which hrw estimated that 1,270 prisoners were massacred.

however, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of greece and turkey respectively.
meanwhile, by 1964, enosis was a greek policy that could not be abandoned; makarios and the greek prime minister georgios papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and king constantine wished cyprus "a speedy union with the mother country".
international pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 37% of the island had been taken over by the turks and 180,000 greek cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north.
around 150,000 settlers from turkey are believed to be living in the north—many of whom were forced from turkey by the turkish government—in violation of the geneva convention and various un resolutions.
cyprus has one of the warmest climates in the mediterranean part of the european union.[citation needed] the average annual temperature on the coast is around 24 °c (75 °f) during the day and 14 °c (57 °f) at night.
cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water.
the country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased.
in 2008, dimitris christofias became the country's first communist head of state.
in 2014, a group of cypriot refugees and a european parliamentarian, later joined by the cypriot government, filed a complaint to the international court of justice, accusing turkey of violating the geneva conventions by directly or indirectly transferring its civilian population into occupied territory.
general michalis flerianos.[citation needed] the evangelos florakis naval base explosion, which occurred on 11 july 2011, was the most deadly military accident ever recorded in cyprus.
of the 10,663 km (6,626 mi) of roads in the republic of cyprus in 1998, 6,249 km (3,883 mi) were paved, and 4,414 km (2,743 mi) were unpaved.
of the 147,405 citizens born in cyprus, 120,031 say both parents were born in cyprus; 16,824 say both parents born in turkey; 10,361 have one parent born in turkey and one parent born in cyprus.
cyprus has two official languages, greek and turkish.
several traditional food (such as souvla and halloumi) and beverages are similar, as well as expressions and ways of life.
however, the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures, with the greek cypriots traditionally being greek orthodox and turkish cypriots traditionally being sunni muslims, which has partly hindered cultural exchange.
seafood and fish dishes include squid, octopus, red mullet, and sea bass.
other traditional delicacies of are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as lountza (smoked pork loin), charcoal-grilled lamb, souvlaki (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and sheftalia (minced meat wrapped in mesentery).

while still a student, he was offered a small unpaid intern job at universal studios with the editing department.
the segment, "eyes," starred joan crawford; she and spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death.
this film and the spielberg-produced gremlins led to the creation of the pg-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences.
in 1985, spielberg released the color purple, an adaptation of alice walker's pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name, about a generation of empowered african-american women during depression-era america.
after two forays into more serious dramatic films, spielberg then directed the third indiana jones film, 1989's indiana jones and the last crusade.

the film starred tom hanks as donovan, as well as mark rylance, amy ryan, and alan alda, with a script by the coen brothers.
he contributed to the project from that time until 1995 when the game was released.
spielberg has filmed and is currently in post-production on an adaptation of roald dahl's celebrated children's story the bfg.
the book follows the true story of a young jewish boy in 1858 italy who was secretly baptized by a family servant and then kidnapped from his family by the papal states, where he was raised and trained as a priest, causing international outrage and becoming a media sensation.
most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances.
spielberg has used tom hanks on several occasions and has cast him in saving private ryan, catch me if you can, the terminal, and bridge of spies.
in 2002, spielberg was one of eight flagbearers who carried the olympic flag into rice-eccles stadium at the opening ceremonies of the 2002 winter olympic games in salt lake city.
he bought orson welles's own directorial copy of the script for the radio broadcast the war of the worlds (1938) in 1994.
since playing pong while filming jaws in 1974, spielberg has been an avid video gamer.
that same year, 1989, saw the release of indiana jones and the last crusade.
he was set to be honored with the cecil b. demille award at the january 2008 golden globes; however, the new, watered-down format of the ceremony resulting from conflicts in the 2007–08 writers strike, the hfpa postponed his honor to the 2009 ceremony.
a water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered.
in 1845, the neapolitan architect gaetano genovese installed in the royal palace of caserta the "flying chair", an elevator ahead of its time, covered with chestnut wood outside and with maple wood inside.
it consisted of a beam pushed outwards by a steel spring.
today the otis elevator company, now a subsidiary of united technologies corporation, is the world's largest manufacturer of vertical transport systems.
the weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight.
this makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab.
they are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight.
the elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft.
in this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers, and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank.
phase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building.
however, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless the firefighter manually pushes and holds the door close button.
some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.
when power is lost in a traction elevator system, all elevators will initially come to a halt.
once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service.
in order to help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors and shut down.
each end of the segment is then secured in a large, hydraulic stretching machine.
freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser.
some types of residential elevators do not use a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, and elevator hoistway.
the asme board first approved machine-room-less systems in a revision of the asme a17.1 in 2007.
dumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food, books or other small freight loads rather than passengers.
in most us and canadian jurisdictions, passenger elevators are required to conform to the american society of mechanical engineers' standard a17.1, safety code for elevators and escalators.
challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 august, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.
after reviewing the documents, they suggest that "adams does not deserve equal credit with le verrier for the discovery of neptune.
in october, he sought to name the planet le verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, françois arago.
in mongolian, neptune is called dalain van (далайн ван), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea.
in 2006, the international astronomical union defined the word "planet" for the first time, reclassifying pluto as a "dwarf planet" and making neptune once again the outermost known planet in the solar system.
as is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid.
the three main rings are the narrow adams ring, 63,000 km from the centre of neptune, the le verrier ring, at 53,000 km, and the broader, fainter galle ring, at 42,000 km.
in 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of neptune's south pole was about 10 k warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 k (−200 °c).
the small dark spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter.
on 11 july 2011, neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit.
the kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from neptune's orbit at 30 au out to about 55 au from the sun.
the first and so far only object identified as associated with neptune's trailing l5 lagrangian point is 2008 lc18.
neptune has 14 known moons.
from july to september 1989, voyager 2 discovered six moons of neptune.
selection of an electrification system is based on economics of energy supply, maintenance, and capital cost compared to the revenue obtained for freight and passenger traffic.
low" voltage is relative; even 600 v can be instantly lethal when touched.)
in portugal, it is used in the cascais line and in denmark on the suburban s-train system.
this effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of dc.
the disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher initial installation costs, higher maintenance costs, and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot.
the problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains.
a few lines of the paris métro in france operate on a four-rail power scheme because they run on rubber tyres which run on a pair of narrow roadways made of steel and, in some places, concrete.
dc commutating electric motors, if fitted with laminated pole pieces, become universal motors because they can also operate on ac; reversing the current in both stator and rotor does not reverse the motor.
but the now-standard ac distribution frequencies of 50 and 60 hz caused difficulties with inductive reactance and eddy current losses.
many railways chose low ac frequencies to overcome these problems.
newly electrified lines often show a "sparks effect", whereby electrification in passenger rail systems leads to significant jumps in patronage / revenue.
many lines have come to be overlaid with multiple electrification standards for different trains to avoid having to replace the existing rolling stock on those lines.
the spanish language is the second most spoken language in the united states.
in 1565, the spaniards, by way of juan ponce de león, founded st. augustine, florida, and as of the early 1800s, it became the oldest continuously occupied european settlement in the continental united states.

through the force of sheer numbers, the english-speaking american settlers entering the southwest established their language, culture, and law as dominant, to the extent it fully displaced spanish in the public sphere; this is why the united states never developed bilingualism as canada did.
for decades, the u.s. federal government strenuously tried to force puerto ricans to adopt english, to the extent of making them use english as the primary language of instruction in their high schools.
immigration to the united states of spanish-speaking cubans began because of cuba's political instability upon achieving independence.
throughout the 1980s with the united states supported contra war (or contra-revolutionary war) which continued up until 1988, and the economic collapse of the country many more nicaraguans migrated to the united states amongst other countries.
in the 2000s, more venezuelans opposing the economic and political policies of president hugo chávez migrated to the united states (mostly to florida, but new york city and houston are other destinations).
although the united states has no de jure official language, english is the dominant language of business, education, government, religion, media, culture, civil society, and the public sphere.
new mexico is commonly thought to have spanish as an official language alongside english because of its wide usage and legal promotion of spanish in the state; however, the state has no official language.
the government of texas, through section 2054.116 of the government code, mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in spanish to assist residents who have limited english proficiency.
moreover, non-hispanic american origin politicians fluent in spanish-speak in spanish to hispanic majority constituencies.
there are 500 spanish newspapers, 152 magazines, and 205 publishers in the united states; magazine and local television advertising expenditures for the hispanic market have increased much from 1999 to 2003, with growth of 58 percent and 43 percent, respectively.

africans were brought to charles town on the middle passage, first as "servants", then as slaves.
ethnic groups transported here included especially wolof, yoruba, fulani, igbo, malinke, and other people of the windward coast.
supported with subsidies from britain, indigo was a leading export by 1750.
by 1708, the majority of the colony's population was slaves, and the future state would continue to be a majority of african descent until after the great migration of the early 20th century.
between 1739 and 1761, the height of the deerskin trade era, an estimated 500,000 to 1,250,000 deer were slaughtered.

the north sea port of hull, a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, was subjected to 86 raids in the hull blitz during the war, with a conservative estimate of 1,200 civilians killed and 95 percent of its housing stock destroyed or damaged.
this thinking was prevalent in both the raf and what was then known as the united states army air corps (usaac) between the two world wars.
he frequently complained of the luftwaffe's inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, "the munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids ... usually the prescribed targets are not hit".
a major problem in the managing of the luftwaffe was hermann göring.
thereafter bombing operations were against ports and shipping and propaganda leaflet drops.
although not specifically prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the luftwaffe was expected to do so over britain.
this involved the bombing of english channel convoys, ports, and raf airfields and supporting industries.
to reduce losses further, a change in strategy was also favoured to take place at night, to give the bombers greater protection under cover of darkness.[b] on 4 september 1940, in a long address at the sportspalast, hitler declared: "and should the royal air force drop two thousand, or three thousand [kilograms ...] then we will now drop [...] 300,000, 400,000, yes one million kilograms in a single night.

the luftwaffe's decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons: hitler did not intend or foresee a war with britain in 1939; the okl believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force; and germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war.
although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the problem for the luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence.
the government saw the communist party's leading role in advocating for building deep shelters as an attempt to damage civilian morale, especially after the molotov-ribbentrop pact of august 1939.:34
noises of battle were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations, but many were killed from direct hits on several stations.
although the intensity of the bombing was not as great as prewar expectations so an equal comparison is impossible, no psychiatric crisis occurred because of the blitz even during the period of greatest bombing of september 1940.
dowding's opponents in the air ministry, already critical of his handling of the day battle (see battle of britain day and the big wing controversy), were ready to use these failings as a cudgel with which to attack him and his abilities.
the criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the air council, and the minister of aircraft production, lord beaverbrook, and churchill themselves intimated their support was waning.
most people aged 35 or over remembered the threat and greeted the bombings with great trepidation.
the difficulty raf bombers had navigating in darkness, led the british to believe german bombers would suffer the same problems and would be unable to reach and identify their targets.
the germans developed the short-range lorenz system into the knickebein aid, a system which used two lorenz beams with much stronger signal transmissions.
soon a beam was traced to derby (which had been mentioned in luftwaffe transmissions).
a number[clarification needed] of bombs fell on these diversionary ("starfish") targets.
of this total around 400 were killed.
fighter command lost 17 fighters and six pilots.
luftwaffe policy at this point was primarily to continue progressive attacks on london, chiefly by night attack; second, to interfere with production in the vast industrial arms factories of the west midlands, again chiefly by night attack; and third to disrupt plants and factories during the day by means of fighter-bombers.
for all the destruction of life and property, the observers sent out by the ministry of home security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale.
for example, in two months of bombing, battersea power station, perhaps the largest single target in london, had only received one minor hit ("a nick").
few anti-aircraft guns had fire-control systems, and the underpowered searchlights were usually ineffective against aircraft at altitudes above 12,000 ft (3,700 m).
aa defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights.
still, in february 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength.
the strategic effect of the raid was a brief 20 percent dip in aircraft production.
at 18:17, it released the first of 10,000 fire bombs, eventually amounting to 300 dropped per minute.
the luftwaffe had dropped 18,291 short tons (16,593 t) of bombs.
port cities were also attacked to try to disrupt trade and sea communications.
in portsmouth southsea and gosport waves of 150 bombers destroyed vast swaths of the city with 40,000 incendiaries.
part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation.
this led to göring and jeschonnek agreeing to hitler's directive 23, directions for operations against the british war economy, which was published on 6 february 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of british imports by sea top priority.
however, meteorological conditions over britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations.
all but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged.
it also helped to support the u-boat blockade by sinking some 58,000 long tons (59,000 t) of shipping destroyed and 450,000 long tons (460,000 t) damaged.
more might have been achieved had the okl exploited their enemy's weak spot, the vulnerability of british sea communications.
some writers claim the air staff ignored a critical lesson, however: british morale did not break.
however, industrial cities were only to be targeted if weather denied strikes on bomber command's main concern, oil.
the "communist threat" was deemed important enough for herbert morrison to order, with the support of the cabinet, the stoppage of the daily worker and the week; the communist newspaper and journal.
anti-semitic attitudes became widespread, particularly in london.
these collections include period interviews with civilians, servicemen, aircrew, politicians and civil defence personnel, as well as blitz actuality recordings, news bulletins and public information broadcasts.
the act is administered by two federal agencies, the united states fish and wildlife service (fws) and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa).
the esa was signed into law by president richard nixon on december 28, 1973, it was designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a "consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation."
it authorized the secretary of the interior to list endangered domestic fish and wildlife and allowed the united states fish and wildlife service to spend up to $15 million per year to buy habitats for listed species.
the act also consolidated and even expanded authority for the secretary of the interior to manage and administer the national wildlife refuge system.
reptiles were added mainly to reduce the rampant poaching of alligators and crocodiles.
a species can be listed in two ways.
all federal agencies are prohibited from authorizing, funding or carrying out actions that "destroy or adversely modify" critical habitats (section 7(a) (2)).
in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of court orders invalidated the reagan regulations and forced the fws and nmfs to designate several hundred critical habitats, especially in hawaii, california and other western states.
if harm cannot be avoided, the project agency can seek an exemption from the endangered species committee, an ad hoc panel composed of members from the executive branch and at least one appointee from the state where the project is to occur.

the "safe harbor" agreement is a voluntary agreement between the private landowner and fws.
green and the cpi further noted another exploit of the esa in their discussion of the critically endangered cotton-top tamarin (saguinus oedipus).
not only had they found documentation that 151 of these primates had inadvertently made their way from the harvard-affiliated new england regional primate research center into the exotic pet trade through the aforementioned loophole, but in october 1976, over 800 cotton-top tamarins were imported into the united states in order to beat the official listing of the species under the esa.
a reward will be paid to any person who furnishes information which leads to an arrest, conviction, or revocation of a license, so long as they are not a local, state, or federal employee in the performance of official duties.
the word stems from the latin adjective vacuus for "vacant" or "void".
in 1930, paul dirac proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the dirac sea.
jean buridan reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open bellows when the port was sealed.
in this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it.
shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the crew altitude protection suit (caps) which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa (15 torr).
as a result, qed vacuum contains vacuum fluctuations (virtual particles that hop into and out of existence), and a finite energy called vacuum energy.
its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation.
entrapment pumps can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration.
the han dynasty (chinese: 漢朝; pinyin: hàn cháo) was the second imperial dynasty of china, preceded by the qin dynasty (221–207 bc) and succeeded by the three kingdoms period (220–280 ad).
the han empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms.
the territories north of han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic xianbei confederation.
on occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor.
the court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.
in china's first known nationwide census taken in 2 ad, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.
the reformists opposed the modernist faction that had dominated court politics in emperor wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of huo guang (d. 68 bc).
wang mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful.
gradual silt buildup in the yellow river had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works.
although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 ad and 11 ad.
the eastern han, also known as the later han, formally began on 5 august 25, when liu xiu became emperor guangwu of han.
their rebellion was crushed by han general ma yuan (d. ad 49) in a campaign from ad 42–43.
other travelers to eastern-han china included buddhist monks who translated works into chinese, such as an shigao of parthia, and lokaksema from kushan-era gandhara, india.
zhang lu's rebellion, in modern northern sichuan and southern shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 ad.
monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers.
apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks, inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property.
however, it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers.
a confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.
biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen.
the most common staple crops consumed during han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans.
domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets).
turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes.
a commandery consisted of a group of counties, and was headed by an administrator.
he was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense, lawsuits, seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by emperor wu.
the small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of eastern han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords.
to eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, emperor wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 bc and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies.
in the early western han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a semi-autonomous king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand.
a significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools.
in southern and small parts of central han-era china, paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice, while farmers along the huai river used transplantation methods of rice production.
around 180 ad, ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings.
as observed in han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff.
three han mathematical treatises still exist.
han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, finding more accurate approximations for pi, providing mathematical proof of the pythagorean theorem, use of the decimal fraction, gaussian elimination to solve linear equations, and continued fractions to find the roots of equations.
although others disagreed with his model, wang chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.
moreover, han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern, in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport, allowing them to sail on the high seas.
han-era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe, namely the cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the five phases.
muslims believe the quran was verbally revealed by god to muhammad through the angel gabriel (jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 december 609 ce, when muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death.
other related words are: dhikr (remembrance), used to refer to the quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and ḥikmah (wisdom), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.
in the large majority of contexts, usually with a definite article (al-), the word is referred to as the "revelation" (waḥy), that which has been "sent down" (tanzīl) at intervals.
however, the quran did not exist in book form at the time of muhammad's death in 632.
the quran describes muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "illiterate," but the meaning is rather more complex.
the manuscript is written in hijazi script, an early form of written arabic.
medieval muslim scholars including al-jurjani (d. 1078) and al-baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the quran.
the 30 juz' (plural ajzāʼ) can be used to read through the entire quran in a month.
for instance, the first verses of sura 22, which deal with the mighty earthquake and the situations of people on that day, represent this style of divine address: "o people!
a number of suras such as 44, 56, 75, 78, 81 and 101 are directly related to the afterlife and its preparations.
the textual arrangement is sometimes considered to exhibit lack of continuity, absence of any chronological or thematic order and repetitiousness.
self-referentiality is evident in those passages where the quran refers to itself as revelation (tanzil), remembrance (dhikr), news (naba'), criterion (furqan) in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its divinity, "and this is a blessed remembrance that we have sent down; so are you now denying it?"),
esoteric or sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meanings of the quran.
from the sufi point of view, god is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.
sulami's major commentary is a book named haqaiq al-tafsir ("truths of exegesis") which is a compilation of commentaries of earlier sufis.
robert of ketton's 1143 translation of the quran for peter the venerable, lex mahumet pseudoprophete, was the first into a western language (latin).
it may be said that this discipline studies the laws and methods of the proper recitation of the quran and covers three main areas: the proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels (the articulation of the quranic phonemes), the rules of pause in recitation and of resumption of recitation, and the musical and melodious features of recitation.
the influential standard quran of cairo (1924) uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻasim's recitation, the 8th-century recitation of kufa.
however, muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient arabia.
currently, the cia world factbook gives 9,826,675 km2 (3,794,100 sq mi), the united nations statistics division gives 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi), and the encyclopædia britannica gives 9,522,055 km2 (3,676,486 sq mi)(great lakes area included but not coastal waters).

in order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the semiconductor laser is placed on a swing arm within the disc tray of any cd player.
the change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected.
the disc can be played on a regular audio cd player, but when played on a special cd+g player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the cd+g player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for karaoke performers to sing along with.
it is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.
first conceived by julius lilienfeld in 1926 and practically implemented in 1947 by american physicists john bardeen, walter brattain, and william shockley, the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics, and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios, calculators, and computers, among other things.
collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current.
the conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals; hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source.
fets are further divided into depletion-mode and enhancement-mode types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage.
the pro electron standard, the european electronic component manufacturers association part numbering scheme, begins with two letters: the first gives the semiconductor type (a for germanium, b for silicon, and c for materials like gaas); the second letter denotes the intended use (a for diode, c for general-purpose transistor, etc.).

a letter suffix (such as "a") is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.
because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor.
the european renaissance (about 1420–1630), which marked the transition between the late middle ages and early modern times, started in italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of classical art and literature, as well as the new perspectives gained from the age of discovery and the invention of the telescope and microscope, expanding the borders of thought and knowledge.
the term "early modern" was introduced in the english language in the 1930s.
in the contemporary era, there were various socio-technological trends.
a concern for western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts.
in china, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex.
large urban centers, such as nanjing and beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry.
chinese merchants explored all of the indian ocean, reaching east africa with the treasure voyages of zheng he.
the manchus then allied with former ming general wu sangui and seized control of beijing, which became the new capital of the qing dynasty.
society in the japanese "tokugawa period" (edo society), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by toyotomi hideyoshi.
the commercial colonization of india commenced in 1757, after the battle of plassey, when the nawab of bengal surrendered his dominions to the british east india company, in 1765, when the company was granted the diwani, or the right to collect revenue, in bengal and bihar, or in 1772, when the company established a capital in calcutta, appointed its first governor-general, warren hastings, and became directly involved in governance.
while the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.
in england the modern period is often dated to the start of the tudor period with the victory of henry vii over richard iii at the battle of bosworth in 1485.
the age of enlightenment is a time in western philosophy and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority.
enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of europe and america.
the people were associated with the studia humanitatis, a novel curriculum that was competing with the quadrivium and scholastic logic.
renaissance humanism took a close study of the latin and greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of scholasticism with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity.
subsequent events that can be traced to the revolution include the napoleonic wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern france took shape.
the first industrial revolution merged into the second industrial revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electric power generation.
following the enlightenment's ideas, the reformers looked to the scientific revolution and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the industrial revolution.
under peter i (the great), russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power.
unchallenged at sea, britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the pax britannica, and a foreign policy of "splendid isolation".
the franco-prussian war was a conflict between france and prussia, while prussia was backed up by the north german confederation, of which it was a member, and the south german states of baden, württemberg and bavaria.
there were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under european colonial rule, to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as "hell on earth."
european countries established a few coastal colonies in africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included cape colony (great britain), angola (portugal), and algeria (france), but until the late nineteenth century europe largely traded with free african states without feeling the need for territorial possession.

these ideas were challenged, for example by the young karl marx, who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of human rights), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose.
he also made important contributions to statistical mechanics, especially his mathematical treatment of brownian motion, his resolution of the paradox of specific heats, and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation.
the last days of the qing dynasty were marked by civil unrest and foreign invasions.
the allied powers, led by the british empire, france, russia until march 1918, japan and the united states after 1917, defeated the central powers, led by the german empire, austro-hungarian empire and the ottoman empire.

following the abdication of nicholas ii of russia, the russian provisional government was established.
the interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order, away from the balance of power that had dominated pre–world war i europe.
a series of international crises strained the league to its limits, the earliest being the invasion of manchuria by japan and the abyssinian crisis of 1935/36 in which italy invaded abyssinia, one of the only free african nations at that time.
it is possible that around 62 million people died in the war; estimates vary greatly.
large-scale industry and more centralized media made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented.
several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western europe, including western germany, which the soviets opposed.
the cold war saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm.
international crises arose, such as the berlin blockade (1948–1949), the korean war (1950–1953), the berlin crisis of 1961, the vietnam war (1959–1975), the cuban missile crisis (1962), the soviet war in afghanistan (1979–1989) and nato exercises in november 1983.

on december 11, 2012, puerto rico's legislature resolved to request that the president and the u.s. congress act on the results, end the current form of territorial status and begin the process of admitting puerto rico to the union as a state.
since 1898, puerto rico has had limited representation in the congress in the form of a resident commissioner, a nonvoting delegate.
puerto ricans have participated in all american wars since 1898; 52 puerto ricans had been killed in the iraq war and war in afghanistan by november 2012.
puerto rico has been under u.s. sovereignty for over a century when it was ceded to the u.s. by spain following the end of the spanish–american war, and puerto ricans have been u.s. citizens since 1917.
this constitution was created when the u.s. congress directed local government to organize a constitutional convention to write the puerto rico constitution in 1951.

occasionally the term "aerial" is used to mean a wire antenna.
the origin of the word antenna relative to wireless apparatus is attributed to italian radio pioneer guglielmo marconi.
radio transmitters and receivers are used to convey signals (information) in systems including broadcast (audio) radio, television, mobile telephones, wi-fi (wlan) data networks, trunk lines and point-to-point communications links (telephone, data networks), satellite links, many remote controlled devices such as garage door openers, and wireless remote sensors, among many others.
the vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a monopole antenna.
chief among these relate to the directional characteristics (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain.
the antenna's power gain (or simply "gain") also takes into account the antenna's efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit.
thus signals near the design frequency will continue to create a standing wave pattern.
the antenna array and very similar reflective array antenna consist of multiple elements, often half-wave dipoles, spaced out on a plane and wired together with transmission lines with specific phase lengths to produce a single in-phase signal at the output.
resonating such an inductor with a capacitor at the frequency of operation not only cancels the reactance but greatly magnifies the very small radiation resistance of such a loop.[citation needed] this is implemented in most am broadcast receivers, with a small ferrite loop antenna resonated by a capacitor which is varied along with the receiver tuning in order to maintain resonance over the am broadcast band
also in the case of a yagi-uda array, the use of the antenna very far away from its design frequency reduces the antenna's directivity, thus reducing the usable bandwidth regardless of impedance matching.
rather than just using a thick tube, there are similar techniques used to the same effect such as replacing thin wire elements with cages to simulate a thicker element.
an example of a high-gain antenna is a parabolic dish such as a satellite television antenna.
the power supplied to the antenna terminals which is not radiated is converted into heat.
for example, ccir rep. 258-3 indicates man-made noise in a residential setting at 40 mhz is about 28 db above the thermal noise floor.
in this case, rather than quoting the antenna gain, one would be more concerned with the directive gain which does not include the effect of antenna (in)efficiency.
thus, a simple straight wire antenna will have one polarization when mounted vertically, and a different polarization when mounted horizontally.
as a transverse wave, the magnetic field of a radio wave is at right angles to that of the electric field, but by convention, talk of an antenna's "polarization" is understood to refer to the direction of the electric field.
thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere (a skywave), a consistent polarization cannot be expected.
a circularly polarized antenna can be used to equally well match vertical or horizontal linear polarizations.
for instance, a "whip antenna" can be made significantly shorter than 1/4 wavelength long, for practical reasons, and then resonated using a so-called loading coil.
they are typically wire antennas multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves travel in one direction, instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing waves as in resonant antennas.
with shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), this is generally the case.
the q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15.
consider a half-wave dipole designed to work with signals 1 m wavelength, meaning the antenna would be approximately 50 cm across.
this leads to the concept of impedance matching, the design of the overall system of antenna and transmission line so the impedance is as close as possible, thereby reducing these losses.
thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground.
in some applications where the receiving antenna must work in any position, as in mobile phones, the base station antennas use mixed polarization, such as linear polarization at an angle (with both vertical and horizontal components) or circular polarization.
loops with circumference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dipole antennas.
the flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as angiospermae or magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with about 350,000 species.
several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved.
that event was studied by sequencing the genome of an ancient flowering plant, amborella trichopoda, and directly addresses darwin's "abominable mystery."
in addition, circumstantial chemical evidence has been found for the existence of angiosperms as early as 250 million years ago.
yet, many fossil plants recognizable as belonging to modern families (including beech, oak, maple, and magnolia) had already appeared by the late cretaceous.
many modern domesticated flower species were formerly simple weeds, which sprouted only when the ground was disturbed.
the internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision.
the rest include a paraphyletic grouping of primitive species known collectively as the basal angiosperms, plus the families ceratophyllaceae and chloranthaceae.
this compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes, showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse.
in apg ii (2003) it is not settled; at maximum it is 457, but within this number there are 55 optional segregates, so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402.
the function of the flower is to ensure fertilization of the ovule and development of fruit containing seeds.
the flower may consist only of these parts, as in willow, where each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels.
in this case, the seed coat is only slightly developed.
established in 1591 by muhammad quli qutb shah, hyderabad remained under the rule of the qutb shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the mughals captured the region.
the influence of mughlai culture is also evident in the city's distinctive cuisine, which includes hyderabadi biryani and hyderabadi haleem.
hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the city of pearls.
the kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the khilji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by sultan alauddin khilji of the delhi sultanate.
the fifth sultan, muhammad quli qutb shah, established hyderabad on the banks of the musi river in 1591, to avoid the water shortages experienced at golkonda.
hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form the modern states of maharashtra, karnataka and andhra pradesh.
it lies on the banks of the musi river, in the northern part of the deccan plateau.
hyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate (köppen aw) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (köppen bsh).
the coolest temperatures occur in december and january, when the lowest temperature occasionally dips to 10 °c (50 °f).
it coordinates the development activities of ghmc and suburban municipalities and manages the administration of bodies such as the hyderabad metropolitan water supply and sewerage board (hmwssb).
only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (bcg, measles and full courses of polio and dpt), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except meerut.:98 the infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births.:97 the survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are underweight,:44, 55–56 while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.:57
the "cyberabad" area in the southwest and west of the city has grown rapidly since the 1990s.
hyderabad's role in the pearl trade has given it the name "city of pearls" and up until the 18th century, the city was also the only global trading centre for large diamonds.
the city is home to hyderabad securities formerly known as hyderabad stock exchange (hse), and houses the regional office of the securities and exchange board of india (sebi).
the mixing of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in hyderabad such as ganesh chaturthi, diwali and bonalu of hindu tradition and eid ul-fitr and eid al-adha by muslims.
lazzat un nisa, a book compiled in the 15th century at qutb shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts.
literary development is further aided by state institutions such as the state central library, the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891, and other major libraries including the sri krishna devaraya andhra bhasha nilayam, the british library and the sundarayya vignana kendram.
besides western and indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events.
although not a purely music oriented event, numaish, a popular annual exhibition of local and national consumer products, does feature some musical performances.

the census bureau population for santa monica in 2010 was 89,736.
santa monica was called kecheek in the tongva language.
santa monica was long inhabited by the tongva people.
one says that it was named in honor of the feast day of saint monica (mother of saint augustine), but her feast day is actually may 4.
third street is closed to vehicles for those three blocks to allow people to stroll, congregate, shop and enjoy street performers.
every fall the santa monica chamber of commerce hosts the taste of santa monica on the santa monica pier.
the groundwater supply in turn plays an important role in the city's sustainable water master plan, whereby santa monica has set a goal of attaining 100% water independence by 2020.
other environmentally focused initiatives include curbside recycling, curbside composting bins (in addition to trash, yard-waste, and recycle bins), farmers' markets, community gardens, garden-share, an urban forest initiative, a hazardous materials home-collection service, green business certification, and a municipal bus system which is currently being revamped to integrate with the soon-to-open expo line.

the city is traversed by the marvin braude bike trail.
the majority of this was property crime, which affected 3.74% of santa monica's population in 2006; this was higher than the rates for los angeles county (2.76%) and california (3.17%), but lower than the national average (3.91%).
however, the santa monica police department has suggested the actual per-capita crime rate is much lower, as tourists, workers, and beachgoers can increase the city's daytime population to between 250,000 and 450,000 people.
they then ran outside to a getaway vehicle driven by a third culver city gang member, who is now also in custody.
crow secured the university charter from the missouri general assembly in 1853, and eliot was named president of the board of trustees.
the renowned philadelphia firm cope & stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of collegiate gothic quadrangles inspired by oxford and cambridge universities.
although chancellor wrighton had noted after the 2004 debate that it would be "improbable" that the university will host another debate and was not eager to commit to the possibility, he subsequently changed his view and the university submitted a bid for the 2008 debates. "
renovations are still ongoing; recent additions to the north campus space include a small eatery operated by bon appétit management company, the university's on-campus food provider, completed during spring semester 2007, as well as the family learning center, operated by bright horizons and opened in september 2010.
it is used by the university as a biological field station and research/education center.
arts & sciences at washington university comprises three divisions: the college of arts & sciences, the graduate school of arts & sciences, and university college in arts & sciences.
founded as the school of commerce and finance in 1917, the olin business school was named after entrepreneur john m. olin in 1988.
graduate students are able to pursue an mba either full-time or part-time.
in addition to affiliation with the university-wide institute of public health, brown houses 12 research centers.
most of the residence halls on campus are located on the south 40, named because of its adjacent location on the south side of the danforth campus and its size of 40 acres (160,000 m2).
only open to upperclassmen and january scholars, the north side consists of millbrook apartments, the village, village east on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the zeta beta tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the south 40.
washington university undergraduates publish two literary and art journals, the eliot review and spires intercollegiate arts and literary magazine.
there have been accidental disclosures; for instance, mary margaret graham, a former cia official and deputy director of national intelligence for collection in 2005, said that the annual intelligence budget was $44 billion, and in 1994 congress accidentally published a budget of $43.4 billion (in 2012 dollars) in 1994 for the non-military national intelligence program, including $4.8 billion for the cia.
pain is usually transitory, lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed, but some painful conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, cancer and idiopathic pain, may persist for years.
nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers that respond to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity (nociceptors), and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation.
paraplegia, the loss of sensation and voluntary motor control after serious spinal cord damage, may be accompanied by girdle pain at the level of the spinal cord damage, visceral pain evoked by a filling bladder or bowel, or, in five to ten per cent of paraplegics, phantom body pain in areas of complete sensory loss.
people with long-term pain frequently display psychological disturbance, with elevated scores on the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory scales of hysteria, depression and hypochondriasis (the "neurotic triad").
when long-term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and anxiety fall, often to normal levels.
the "specificity" (whether it responds to thermal, chemical or mechanical features of its environment) of a nociceptor is determined by which ion channels it expresses at its peripheral end.
spinal cord fibers dedicated to carrying a-delta fiber pain signals, and others that carry both a-delta and c fiber pain signals up the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain have been identified.
other spinal cord fibers, known as wide dynamic range neurons, respond to a-delta and c fibers, but also to the large a-beta fibers that carry touch, pressure and vibration signals.
the relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors (lack of food, too much cold, or serious injuries are felt as agony, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort).
a person's self-report is the most reliable measure of pain, with health care professionals tending to underestimate severity.
analysis of mpi results by turk and rudy (1988) found three classes of chronic pain patient: "(a) dysfunctional, people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high, reported that pain interfered with much of their lives, reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and reported low levels of activity; (b) interpersonally distressed, people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems; and (c) adaptive copers, patients who reported high levels of social support, relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference, and relatively high levels of activity."
many people fear the stigma of addiction and avoid pain treatment so as not to be prescribed potentially addicting drugs.
the presence of pain in an animal cannot be known for certain, but it can be inferred through physical and behavioral reactions.
database management systems are often classified according to the database model that they support; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model as represented by the sql language.[disputed – discuss] sometimes a dbms is loosely referred to as a 'database'.
access to these data is usually provided by a "database management system" (dbms) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data).
however, the fact that their development cost can be spread over a large number of users means that they are often the most cost-effective approach.
as computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use.
the relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship, like a traditional hierarchical model, and many-to-many relationship, like a navigational (network) model.
in the navigational approach all of this data would be placed in a single record, and unused items would simply not be placed in the database.
in the relational model, some bit of information was used as a "key", uniquely defining a particular record.
codd's solution to the necessary looping was a set-oriented language, a suggestion that would later spawn the ubiquitous sql.
object databases and object-relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to sql) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational sql.
on one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level).
though typically accessed by a dbms through the underlying operating system (and often utilizing the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the dbms, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators.
to achieve this a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively).
roughly 150 tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics systems, earning tucson the nickname optics valley.

the ancient armenian kingdom was split between the byzantine and sasanian empires around the early 5th century.
between the 16th century and 19th century, the traditional armenian homeland composed of eastern armenia and western armenia came under the rule of the ottoman and successive iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries.
he relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persians.
a large cuneiform lapidary inscription found in yerevan established that the modern capital of armenia was founded in the summer of 782 bc by king argishti i. yerevan is the world's oldest city to have documented the exact date of its foundation.
the kingdom became fully sovereign from the sphere of influence of the seleucid empire in 190 bc under king artaxias i and begun the rule of the artaxiad dynasty.
armenia reached its height between 95 and 66 bc under tigranes the great, becoming the most powerful kingdom of its time east of the roman republic.
in the next centuries, armenia was in the persian empire's sphere of influence during the reign of tiridates i, the founder of the arsacid dynasty of armenia, which itself was a branch of the eponymous arsacid dynasty of parthia.
when they began pushing for more rights within the ottoman empire, sultan ‘abdu’l-hamid ii, in response, organized state-sponsored massacres against the armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in an estimated death toll of 80,000 to 300,000 people.
during the 1890s, the armenian revolutionary federation, commonly known as dashnaktsutyun, became active within the ottoman empire with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the armenian-populated areas of the empire.
the genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the syrian desert.

fears decreased when stalin died in 1953 and nikita khruschev emerged as the soviet union's new leader.
compounding armenia's problems was a devastating earthquake in 1988 with a moment magnitude of 7.2.
tensions also developed between soviet azerbaijan and its autonomous district of nagorno-karabakh, a majority-armenian region separated by stalin from armenia in 1923.
by the time both azerbaijan and armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994, an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced.
according to the us census bureau, there are 427,822 armenians living in the country.

the ministry of defence is in charge of political leadership, currently headed by colonel general seyran ohanyan, while military command remains in the hands of the general staff, headed by the chief of staff, who is currently colonel general yuri khatchaturov.
in addition, the effects of the 1988 spitak earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.
nowadays the university is ranked among famous higher medical institutions and takes its honorable place in the world directory of medical schools published by the who.
later, stemming from the middle eastern armenian diaspora and influenced by continental european (especially french) pop music, the armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 1960s and 1970s with artists such as adiss harmandian and harout pamboukjian performing to the armenian diaspora and armenia; also with artists such as sirusho, performing pop music combined with armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry.
other armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned french-armenian singer and composer charles aznavour, pianist sahan arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as hasmik papian and more recently isabel bayrakdarian and anna kasyan.
these songs encourage armenian patriotism and are generally about armenian history and national heroes.
it also hosts the pan-armenian games.
the rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the armenian government.
due to the lack of success lately on the international level, in recent years, armenia has rebuilt 16 soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9 million.
once regarded as plants constituting the class schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes.
this wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.
bacteria can also be elongated to form filaments, for example the actinobacteria.
for example, when starved of amino acids, myxobacteria detect surrounding cells in a process known as quorum sensing, migrate toward each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500 micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells.
the general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space.
however, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane.
these light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.
the enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.
endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing dna and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat.
endospores show no detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses, such as high levels of uv light, gamma radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and desiccation.
bacteria are further divided into lithotrophs that use inorganic electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors.
bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction.
in the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media.
spirochaetes of the genus borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement, with bacteria such as borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of lyme disease, containing a single linear chromosome.

transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than a bacterial adaptation.
transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than a bacterial adaptation.
transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for dna transfer.
in order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor dna into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see natural competence).
in ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of dna between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.
many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome.
to overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasizes molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridization, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rrna gene.
the archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria.
the thick layers of peptidoglycan in the "gram-positive" cell wall stain purple, while the thin "gram-negative" cell wall appears pink.
one such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic archaea that consume hydrogen.
this serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves.
bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth.
antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations.
the ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and bioremediation.
bacteria were first observed by the dutch microscopist antonie van leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.
though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available.
in 1910, paul ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained treponema pallidum — the spirochaete that causes syphilis — into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen.
ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 nobel prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the gram stain and the ziehl–neelsen stain.

when the board has no embedded components it is more correctly called a printed wiring board (pwb) or etched wiring board.
usually a panel consists of a single design but sometimes multiple designs are mixed on a single panel.
there are two types of panels: assembly panels - often called arrays - and bare board manufacturing panels.
the advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced.
drilling with high-speed-steel is simply not feasible since the drill bits will dull quickly and thus tear the copper and ruin the boards.
the etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.
in boundary scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ics on the board form temporary connections between the pcb traces to test that the ics are mounted correctly.
horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends.
for microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in the form of stripline and microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance.
the cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (fr-4, cem-1, g-10, etc.)
some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (teflon), fr-4, fr-1, cem-1 or cem-3.
below tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher.
absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for "popcorning" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts.
the printed circuit board industry defines heavy copper as layers exceeding three ounces of copper, or approximately 0.0042 inches (4.2 mils, 105 μm) thick.
pcb designers and fabricators often use heavy copper when design and manufacturing circuit boards in order to increase current-carrying capacity as well as resistance to thermal strains.
cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space was at a premium (such as missile guidance and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important.
one disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made.
arthur berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in britain, and in the united states max schoop obtained a patent to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask.
it was not until 1984 that the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) awarded mr. harry w. rubinstein, the former head of globe union's centralab division, its coveted cledo brunetti award for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate.
in 1949, moe abramson and stanislaus f. danko of the united states army signal corps developed the auto-sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered.
around 1200 bc, the dorians, another greek-speaking people, followed from epirus.
according to some scholars, the foundational event was the olympic games in 776 bc, when the idea of a common hellenism among the greek tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture.
the classical period of greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century bc to the death of alexander the great, in 323 bc (some authors prefer to split this period into 'classical', from the end of the persian wars to the end of the peloponnesian war, and 'fourth century', up to the death of alexander).
from the early centuries of the common era, the greeks identified as romaioi ("romans"), by that time the name ‘hellenes’ denoted pagans.
concurrently the secular, urban civilization of late antiquity survived in the eastern mediterranean along with greco-roman educational system, although it was from christianity that the culture's essential values were drawn.
in greek-inhabited territory itself, greeks came to play a leading role in the ottoman empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on western thrace and greek macedonia, both in northern greece, and of course was centred on the mainly greek-populated, former byzantine capital, constantinople.
a century later, when the treaty of lausanne was signed between greece and turkey in 1923, the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange, although most of the greeks displaced (over a million of the total 1.5 million) had already been driven out by the time the agreement was signed.[note 1] the greek genocide, in particular the harsh removal of pontian greeks from the southern shore area of the black sea, contemporaneous with and following the failed greek asia minor campaign, was part of this process of turkification of the ottoman empire and the placement of its economy and trade, then largely in greek hands under ethnic turkish control.
this was an ancient association of greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of apollo in delphi (phocis) and of demeter near thermopylae (locris).
the word γραῖα graia "old woman" comes from the pie root *ǵerh2-/*ǵreh2-, "to grow old" via proto-greek *gera-/grau-iu; the same root later gave γέρας geras (/keras/), "gift of honour" in mycenean greek.
there are smaller greek minorities in the rest of the balkan countries, the levant and the black sea states, remnants of the old greek diaspora (pre-19th century).
estimates provided by the sae - world council of hellenes abroad put the figure at around 7 million worldwide.
according to george prevelakis of sorbonne university, the number is closer to just below 5 million.
ottoman greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century but nevertheless included cultural exchanges and enriched both cultures.
notable modern greek artists include renaissance painter dominikos theotokopoulos (el greco), panagiotis doxaras, nikolaos gyzis, nikiphoros lytras, yannis tsarouchis, nikos engonopoulos, constantine andreou, jannis kounellis, sculptors such as leonidas drosis, georgios bonanos, yannoulis chalepas and joannis avramidis, conductor dimitri mitropoulos, soprano maria callas, composers such as mikis theodorakis, nikos skalkottas, iannis xenakis, manos hatzidakis, eleni karaindrou, yanni and vangelis, one of the best-selling singers worldwide nana mouskouri and poets such as kostis palamas, dionysios solomos, angelos sikelianos and yannis ritsos.
outside the uk it is commonly referred to as the english premier league (epl).
the premier league is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential tv audience of 4.7 billion people.

however, by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse; england had been successful in the 1990 fifa world cup, reaching the semi-finals.
television money had also become much more important; the football league received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but when that deal was renewed in 1988, the price rose to £44 million over four years.

at the close of the 1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall.
in 1992, the first division clubs resigned from the football league en masse and on 27 may 1992 the fa premier league was formed as a limited company working out of an office at the football association's then headquarters in lancaster gate.
the league held its first season in 1992–93 and was originally composed of 22 clubs.
criticism of the gap between an elite group of "super clubs" and the majority of the premier league has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other premier league clubs.
if the premier league has one of the three highest fair play rankings in europe, the highest ranked team in the premier league fair play standings which has not already qualified for europe will automatically qualify for the uefa europa league first qualifying round.
an exception to the usual european qualification system happened in 2005, after liverpool won the champions league the year before, but did not finish in a champions league qualification place in the premier league that season.
uefa gave special dispensation for liverpool to enter the champions league, giving england five qualifiers.
however, for those leagues with four entrants in the champions league, this meant that if the champions league winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league.
the fifa club world cup (or the fifa club world championship, as it was originally called) has been won by premier league clubs once (manchester united in 2008), and they have also been runners-up twice, behind brazil's brasileirão with four wins, and spain's la liga and italy's serie a with two wins each (see table here).
in 2010 the premier league was awarded the queen's award for enterprise in the international trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to english football and the united kingdom's broadcasting industry.
however, a combination of sky's strategy, the quality of premier league football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the premier league's tv rights soar.
at the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the uk market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football.
the money is divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this.

the next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.
in july 1999 the premier league's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the uk restrictive practices court, who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.
the tv rights agreement between the premier league and sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases have arisen as a result.
nbc sports reached a six-year extension with the premier league in 2015 to broadcast the league through the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).
premier league viewership has increased rapidly, with nbc and nbcsn averaging a record 479,000 viewers in the 2014–15 season, up 118% from 2012–13 when coverage still aired on fox soccer and espn/espn2 (220,000 viewers), and nbc sports has been widely praised for its coverage.
owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues, many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the premier league.
though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average premier league team receives £55 million while the average football league championship club receives £2 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the premier league and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams "bouncing back" soon after their relegation.
the hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent taylor report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished; as a result all stadiums in the premier league are all-seater.
the hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent taylor report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished; as a result all stadiums in the premier league are all-seater.
the stadiums for the 2010–11 season show a large disparity in capacity: old trafford, the home of manchester united has a capacity of 75,957 with bloomfield road, the home of blackpool, having a capacity of 16,220.
the premier league's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season.
their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.
the uefa pro licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the premier league on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).
at the inception of the premier league in 1992–93, just eleven players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the united kingdom or ireland.

on 26 december 1999, chelsea became the first premier league side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up, and on 14 february 2005 arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.
if a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.
as of the 2010–11 season, the premier league introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.
the record rose steadily in the premier league's first few seasons, until alan shearer made a record breaking £15 million move to newcastle united in 1996.
the three highest transfer in the sport's history had a premier league club on the selling end, with tottenham hotspur selling gareth bale to real madrid for £85 million in 2013, manchester united's sale of cristiano ronaldo to real madrid for £80 million in 2009, and liverpool selling luis suárez to barcelona for £75 million in 2014.
former blackburn rovers and newcastle united striker alan shearer holds the record for most premier league goals with 260.
since the first premier league season in 1992–93, 14 different players from 10 different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title.
the plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed.
over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy.
this growing coalition expanded the potential enemies that rome might face, and moved rome closer to confrontation with major powers.
rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with pyrrhus as long as his army remained in italy.
the carthaginians then hired xanthippus of carthage, a spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army.
the situation was made worse by the fact that hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the seleucid emperor, and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of greece, but of rome itself.
the seleucids were much stronger than the macedonians had ever been, because they controlled much of the former persian empire, and by now had almost entirely reassembled alexander the great's former empire.

jugurtha impudently bribed the romans into accepting his usurpation.
although they lost militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 italians.
mithridates the great was the ruler of pontus, a large kingdom in asia minor (modern turkey), from 120 to 63 bc.
in 51 bc, some roman senators demanded that caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left caesar defenceless before his enemies.
at the naval battle of actium off the coast of greece, octavian decisively defeated antony and cleopatra.
it also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate.
the plebeians rebelled by leaving rome and refusing to return until they had more rights.
the senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy.
the movement was based in the town of faesulae, which was a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation.
virtually all the conspirators fled the city after caesar's death in fear of retaliation.
the second is the civil war, which plagued the roman republic in its final century.
according to livy and dionysius of halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment.
one disadvantage of the phalanx was that it was only effective when fighting in large, open spaces, which left the romans at a disadvantage when fighting in the hilly terrain of central italian peninsula.
rome's italian allies would be organized in alae, or wings, roughly equal in manpower to the roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.
during the 2nd century bc, roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars.
after having declined in size following the subjugation of the mediterranean, the roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late republic to meet several new demands.
usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly.
all actions were treated as "torts," which were brought by an accuser who was forced to prove the entire case himself.

the city of rome had a place called the campus martius ("field of mars"), which was a sort of drill ground for roman soldiers.
japanese officials integrated what they called the japan–china incident (日支事変, nisshi jihen?)
the axis states which assisted japan included the authoritarian government of thailand in world war ii, which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the japanese in 1941, as the japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern thailand.
the policy of the u.s. government ever since 1945 has been to treat thailand not as a former enemy, but rather as a country which had been forced into certain actions by japanese blackmail, before being occupied by japanese troops.
the major allied participants were the united states, the republic of china, the united kingdom (including the armed forces of british india, the fiji islands, samoa, etc.),
the marco polo bridge incident on 7 july 1937 provoked full-scale war between china and japan.
in august of 1940, chinese communists launched an offensive in central china; in retaliation, japan instituted the "three alls policy" ("kill all, burn all, loot all") in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.
japanese troop build ups in hainan, taiwan, and haiphong were noted, japanese army officers were openly talking about an inevitable war, and admiral sankichi takahashi was reported as saying a showdown with the united states was necessary.
the japanese media, influenced by military propagandists,[nb 10] began to refer to the embargoes as the "abcd ("american-british-chinese-dutch") encirclement" or "abcd line".
in an effort to discourage japanese militarism, western powers including australia, the united states, britain, and the dutch government in exile, which controlled the petroleum-rich dutch east indies, stopped selling oil, iron ore, and steel to japan, denying it the raw materials needed to continue its activities in china and french indochina.
in the early hours of 7 december (hawaiian time), japan launched a major surprise carrier-based air strike on pearl harbor without explicit warning, which crippled the u.s. pacific fleet, leaving eight american battleships out of action, 188 american aircraft destroyed, and 2,403 american citizens dead.

alerted to the need of a second strike on midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the american carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity, nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft.
with the japanese cap out of position and the carriers at their most vulnerable, sbd dauntlesses from enterprise and yorktown appeared at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and commenced their attack, quickly dealing fatal blows to three fleet carriers: sōryū, kaga, and akagi.
in mainland china, the japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th divisions massed at yueyang and advanced southward in three columns and crossed the xinqiang river, and tried again to cross the miluo river to reach changsha.
by early 1945 japanese oil supplies were so limited that its fleet was virtually stranded.
worst of all, before the war, an uninformed us customs officer had seized a copy of the japanese merchant marine code (called the "maru code" in the usn), not knowing that the office of naval intelligence (oni) had broken it.
a japanese division which had advanced to kohima in nagaland cut the main road to imphal, but failed to capture the whole of the defences at kohima.
although the advance in the arakan had been halted to release troops and aircraft for the battle of imphal, the americans and chinese had continued to advance in northern burma, aided by the chindits operating against the japanese lines of communication.
kurita's "center force" consisted of five battleships, 12 cruisers and 13 destroyers.
nishimura and shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other.
r. adm. jesse oldendorf had six battleships, four heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, 29 destroyers and 39 pt boats.
palawan island, between borneo and mindoro, the fifth largest and western-most philippine island, was invaded on 28 february with landings of the eighth army at puerto princesa.
on 19 february 1945, some 30,000 men of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th marine divisions landed on the southeast coast of iwo, just under mount suribachi; where most of the island's defenses were concentrated.
on 23 february, the 28th marine regiment reached the summit of suribachi, prompting the now famous raising the flag on iwo jima picture.
the largest and bloodiest american battle came at okinawa, as the u.s. sought airbases for 3,000 b-29 bombers and 240 squadrons of b-17 bombers for the intense bombardment of japan's home islands in preparation for a full-scale invasion in late 1945.
on 10 august the "sacred decision" was made by japanese cabinet to accept the potsdam terms on one condition: the "prerogative of his majesty as a sovereign ruler".
the formal japanese instrument of surrender was signed on 2 september 1945, on the battleship uss missouri, in tokyo bay.
san diego is the birthplace of california and is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches, long association with the united states navy and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center.
in november 1602, sebastián vizcaíno was sent to map the california coast.
the mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain san diego as part of mexico, but the americans insisted that san diego was "for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of san francisco," and the mexican-american border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of san diego bay, so as to include the entire bay within the united states.
two years later the city was bankrupt; the california legislature revoked the city's charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees, where it remained until 1889.
by 1930, the city was host to naval base san diego, naval training center san diego, san diego naval hospital, camp matthews, and camp kearny (now marine corps air station miramar).

according to forbes in 2005, san diego was the fifth wealthiest u.s. city but about 10.6% of families and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over.
males had a median income of $36,984 versus $31,076 for females.

a famous example of arabic poetry and persian poetry on romance (love) is layla and majnun, dating back to the umayyad era in the 7th century.
it is a tragic story of undying love much like the later romeo and juliet, which was itself said to have been inspired by a latin version of layla and majnun to an extent.
ibn tufail wrote the first arabic novel hayy ibn yaqdhan (philosophus autodidactus) as a response to al-ghazali's the incoherence of the philosophers, and then ibn al-nafis also wrote a novel theologus autodidactus as a response to ibn tufail's philosophus autodidactus.

a latin translation of ibn tufail's work, philosophus autodidactus, first appeared in 1671, prepared by edward pococke the younger, followed by an english translation by simon ockley in 1708, as well as german and dutch translations.
philosophus autodidactus, continuing the thoughts of philosophers such as aristotle from earlier ages, inspired robert boyle to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, the aspiring naturalist.
these works are said to have been inspired by several moorish delegations from morocco to elizabethan england at the beginning of the 17th century.
other influential muslim philosophers include al-jahiz, a pioneer in evolutionary thought; ibn al-haytham (alhazen), a pioneer of phenomenology and the philosophy of science and a critic of aristotelian natural philosophy and aristotle's concept of place (topos); al-biruni, a critic of aristotelian natural philosophy; ibn tufail and ibn al-nafis, pioneers of the philosophical novel; shahab al-din suhrawardi, founder of illuminationist philosophy; fakhr al-din al-razi, a critic of aristotelian logic and a pioneer of inductive logic; and ibn khaldun, a pioneer in the philosophy of history.

this led to an early scientific method being developed in the muslim world, where progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of ibn al-haytham (alhazen) on optics from circa 1000, in his book of optics.
recent studies show that it is very likely that the medieval muslim artists were aware of advanced decagonal quasicrystal geometry (discovered half a millennium later in the 1970s and 1980s in the west) and used it in intricate decorative tilework in the architecture.
in astronomy, muḥammad ibn jābir al-ḥarrānī al-battānī improved the precision of the measurement of the precession of the earth's axis.

muslims are the majority in 49 countries, they speak hundreds of languages and come from diverse ethnic backgrounds.
sunnis believe the true political successor of the prophet in sunnah is based on ٍshura (consultation) at the saqifah which selected abu bakr, father of the prophet's favourite wife, 'a'ishah, to lead the islamic community while the religious succession ceased to exist on account of finality of prophethood.
instead, muslims describe god by the names and attributes that, according to islam, he revealed to his creation.
these rules for dressing cause tensions, concerning particularly muslims living in western countries, where restrictions are considered both sexist and oppressive.

tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading cultural and economic center.

iran's neanderthal artifacts from the middle paleolithic period, c. 200,000–40,000 bc, have been found mainly in the zagros region, at sites such as warwasi and yafteh cave.[page needed] around 10th to 8th millennium bc, early agricultural communities such as chogha golan and chogha bonut began to flourish in iran, as well as susa and chogha mish developing in and around the zagros region.[page needed]
the parthian empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries, until 224 ce, when it was succeeded by the sassanid empire.
gunde shapur, home of the academy of gunde shapur which was the most important medical center of the world at the time, survived after the invasion, but became known as an islamic institute thereafter.
after the 10th century, persian language, alongside arabic, was used for the scientific, philosophical, historical, musical, and medical works, whereas the important iranian writers, such as tusi, avicenna, qotb od din shirazi, and biruni, had major contributions in the scientific writing.
the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas the great, 1587–1629, surpassing their ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in western eurasia for the sciences and arts.
in 1795, following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians, the qajars captured tblisi by the battle of krtsanisi, and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus, reestablishing a short-lived iranian suzerainty over the region.
as a result of the 19th century russo-persian wars, the russians took over the caucasus, and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region (comprising modern-day dagestan, georgia, armenia, and azerbaijan), which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay.

as the soviet union refused to relinquish the occupied iranian territory, the iran crisis of 1946 was followed, which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states, and the withdrawal of the soviets.
by 1975 and 1976, an economic recession led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s.
annual precipitation is 680 mm (26.8 in) in the eastern part of the plain and more than 1,700 mm (66.9 in) in the western part.

to the west, settlements in the zagros basin experience lower temperatures, severe winters with below zero average daily temperatures and heavy snowfall.
average summer temperatures rarely exceed 38 °c (100.4 °f).

the guardian council comprises twelve jurists including six appointed by the supreme leader.
the special clerical court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving lay people.
this has led the un security council to impose sanctions against iran which had further isolated iran politically and economically from the rest of the global community.
sanctions have led to a steep fall in the value of the rial, and as of april 2013 one us dollar is worth 36,000 rial, compared with 16,000 in early 2012.
as with the spoken languages, the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate, mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups, the persians and azerbaijanis, due to the lack of iranian state censuses based on ethnicity.
around 90% of iran's e-commerce takes place on the iranian online store of digikala, which has around 750,000 visitors per day and more than 2.3 million subscribers.
as a result, britain and ireland is used as an alternative description, and atlantic archipelago has had limited use among a minority in academia, although british isles is still commonly employed.
the earliest known use of the phrase brytish iles in the english language is dated 1577 in a work by john dee.
over the last 500 million years the land that forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30°s, crossing the equator around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.
the islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central ireland and southern great britain particularly low lying: the lowest point in the islands is holme, cambridgeshire at −2.75 m (−9.02 ft).
as europe, including britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of roman civilisation, an era known as the dark ages, ireland entered a golden age and responded with missions (first to great britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities.
there are two sovereign states in the isles: ireland and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland.
ireland, the united kingdom and the three crown dependencies are all parliamentary democracies, with their own separate parliaments.
originally it comprised 25 members of the oireachtas, the irish parliament, and 25 members of the parliament of the united kingdom, with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures.
the council does not have executive powers but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance.
irish newspapers are also available in the uk, and irish state and private television is widely available in northern ireland.[citation needed] certain reality tv shows have embraced the whole of the islands, for example the x factor, seasons 3, 4 and 7 of which featured auditions in dublin and were open to irish voters, whilst the show previously known as britain's next top model became britain and ireland's next top model in 2011.
several potential irish sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the tusker tunnel between the ports of rosslare and fishguard proposed by the institute of engineers of ireland in 2004.

the layout of a team's players is known as a formation.
the world's oldest football competition is the fa cup, which was founded by c. w. alcock and has been contested by english teams since 1872.
fifa, the international football body, was formed in paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to laws of the game of the football association.
it had a "golden age" in the united kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches; this was stopped on 5 december 1921 when england's football association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs.
players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches.
as the laws were formulated in england, and were initially administered solely by the four british football associations within ifab, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.
this area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them.
a standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves.
originally, the event was for amateurs only; however, since the 1984 summer olympics, professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides.
these are the european championship (uefa), the copa américa (conmebol), african cup of nations (caf), the asian cup (afc), the concacaf gold cup (concacaf) and the ofc nations cup (ofc).
the governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results.
the top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.
it is eponymous for the first four british monarchs of the house of hanover—george i, george ii, george iii, and george iv—who reigned in continuous succession from august 1714 to june 1830.
the period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession; before the mid-century "the high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by anyone who could get away with it".
in the mainstream of georgian style were both palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives, gothic and chinoiserie, which were the english-speaking world's equivalent of european rococo.
leading exponents were william wilkins and robert smirke.
in grand houses, an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were.
columns or pilasters, often topped by a pediment, were popular for ornament inside and out, and other ornament was generally geometrical or plant-based, rather than using the human figure.
versions of the neo-georgian style were commonly used in britain for certain types of urban architecture until the late 1950s, bradshaw gass & hope's police headquarters in salford of 1958 being a good example.
these resulted in the deaths and displacement of more than half a million people and devastated liberia's economy.
additionally, as inland regions underwent desertification, inhabitants moved to the wetter coast.
it excluded the indigenous tribesmen from birthright citizenship in their own lands until 1904, in a repetition of the united states' treatment of native americans.
the rebels soon split into various factions fighting one another.
the senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators.
there is a high percentage of interracial marriage between ethnic liberians and the lebanese, resulting in a significant mixed-race population especially in and around monrovia.
liberia hosted national fairs in 1857 and 1858 in which prizes were awarded for various needle arts.
beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics.
whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.
he was elected dean of the faculty of science at the university of london in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the university of london's senate in 1919, and chairman of the senate's academic (leadership) council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for america in 1924.
in addition to numerous articles on mathematics, whitehead wrote three major books on the subject: a treatise on universal algebra (1898), principia mathematica (co-written with bertrand russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913), and an introduction to mathematics (1911).
whitehead and russell had thought originally that principia mathematica would take a year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years.
but beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.

in it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called "inert ideas" – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture.
for whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary, value-free school model – it should be transdisciplinary, and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate.
rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.
in one letter to his friend and former student bertrand russell, after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: "this further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter."
in whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned.
in this, he went against descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental.
whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as "philosophy of organism", but it would become known more widely as "process philosophy."
his philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the western canon.
however, mathews' frustration with whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest.
though process and reality has been called "arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century," it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as isabelle stengers puts it – "that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus."
these occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a "society" of events.
in whitehead's view, then, concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form" are problematic.
these occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a "society" of events.
whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech.
in fact, whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it.
in fact, whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it.
a real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist.
for whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws.
whitehead describes causal efficacy as "the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go."
presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as "pure sense perception", unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation, even unconscious interpretation.
in higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what whitehead terms "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it.
in this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).
whitehead thus sees god and the world as fulfilling one another.
he took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a "dangerous delusion" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).
in this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent.
one of the first theologians to attempt to interact with whitehead's thought was the future archbishop of canterbury, william temple.
this work has been pioneered by john b. cobb, jr., whose book is it too late?
cobb also co-authored a book with economist herman daly entitled for the common good: redirecting the economy toward community, the environment, and a sustainable future (1989), which applied whitehead's thought to economics, and received the grawemeyer award for ideas improving world order.
feels" stands for five things in curriculum and education: flexible-goals, engaged-learner, embodied-knowledge, learning-through-interactions, and supportive-teacher.
this has led to widespread problems with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance, so much as to prompt the world health organization to classify antimicrobial resistance as a "serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country".
their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse, especially in livestock raising, prompting bacteria to develop resistance.
empirical therapy is usually initiated before the doctor knows the exact identification of microorgansim causing the infection as the identification process make take several days in the laboratory.
antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus candida in the vulvo-vaginal area.
exposure to antibiotics early in life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models.
the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills, such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%).

effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial.
despite the lack of a categorical counterindication, the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread.
following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline), oxazolidinones (such as linezolid), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin).
emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy.
antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.
other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery.
the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970 (swann report 1969), and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003.
in 1939, coinciding with the start of world war ii, rene dubos reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, tyrothricin, a compound of 20% gramicidin and 80% tyrocidine, from b. brevis.
the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin in 1945.
windows 8 added support for usb 3.0, advanced format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing.
although reaction towards its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn (especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen).
despite these shortcomings, 60 million windows 8 licenses have been sold through january 2013, a number which included both upgrades and sales to oems for new pcs.
windows division president steven sinofsky demonstrated an early build of the port on prototype devices, while microsoft ceo steve ballmer announced the company's goal for windows to be "everywhere on every kind of device without compromise."
milestone 2, build 7955, was leaked on april 25, 2011.
windows president steven sinofsky said more than 100,000 changes had been made since the developer version went public.
on may 31, 2012, windows 8 release preview was released to the public by microsoft.
on june 12, 2013 during game 1 of the 2013 stanley cup finals, microsoft premiered the first ad in its "windows everywhere" campaign, which promoted windows 8, windows phone 8, and the company's suite of online services as an interconnected platform.
additionally, the blue screen of death has been updated with a simpler and modern design with less technical information displayed.
internet explorer 10 is included as both a desktop program and a touch-optimized app, and includes increased support for html5, css3, and hardware acceleration.
apps can use "contracts"; a collection of hooks to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps, including search and sharing.
in an interview on september 12, 2012, soma somasegar (vice president of microsoft's development software division) confirmed that "windows store apps" would be the official term for the apps.
the developers of both chrome and firefox committed to developing metro-style versions of their browsers; while chrome's "windows 8 mode" uses a full-screen version of the existing desktop interface, firefox's version (which was first made available on the "aurora" release channel in september 2013) uses a touch-optimized interface inspired by the android version of firefox.
the start screen displays a customizable array of tiles linking to various apps and desktop programs, some of which can display constantly updated information and content through "live tiles".
on march 12, 2013, microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of 1024×768 (down from the previous 1366×768).
a port of windows 8 for arm architecture, windows rt, is marketed as an edition of windows 8, but was only included as pre-loaded software on devices specifically developed for it.
the three desktop editions of windows 8 support 32-bit and 64-bit architectures; retail copies of windows 8 include install dvds for both architectures, while the online installer automatically installs the version corresponding with the architecture of the system's existing windows installation.
several notable video game developers criticized microsoft for making its windows store a closed platform subject to its own regulations, as it conflicted with their view of the pc as an open platform.
markus "notch" persson (creator of the indie game minecraft), gabe newell (co-founder of valve corporation and developer of software distribution platform steam), and rob pardo from activision blizzard voiced concern about the closed nature of the windows store.
other improvements and features (such as file history, storage spaces, and the updated task manager) were also regarded as positive changes.
the interface of windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction.
nkhosi literally means "king".
in 1903, after british victory in the anglo-boer war, swaziland became a british protectorate.
following this, swaziland was partitioned into european and non-european (or native reserves) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land.
the nominations are for the position of member of parliament, constituency headman (indvuna) and the constituency executive committee (bucopho).
about 75% of the population is employed in subsistence agriculture upon swazi nation land (snl).
on the positive side, the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years, and domestic debt is almost negligible; external debt as a percent of gdp was less than 20% in 2006.
the swazi economy is very closely linked to the economy of south africa, from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports.
in 2004, the swaziland government acknowledged for the first time that it suffered an aids crisis, with 38.8% of tested pregnant women infected with hiv (see aids in africa).
the examination council of swaziland (ecos) administers this examination.
simpa is a government owned management and development institute and idm is a regional organisation in botswana, lesotho and swaziland that provides training, consultancy, and research in management.

the english word "translation" derives from the latin translatio (which itself comes from trans- and from fero, the supine form of which is latum—together meaning "a carrying across" or "a bringing across").
except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early christian period and the middle ages, and adapters in various periods (especially pre-classical rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents — "literal" where possible, paraphrastic where necessary — for the original meaning and other crucial "values" (e.g., style, verse form, concordance with musical accompaniment or, in films, with speech articulatory movements) as determined from context.
generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them.
though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-western or pre-western environments.
in terms of theory, arabic translation drew heavily on earlier near eastern traditions as well as more contemporary greek and persian traditions.
arabic and, to a lesser degree, persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized western traditions, which in time would overtake the islamic and oriental traditions.
mark twain provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a french translation of his short story, "the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county".
subsequently given along with other women to the invading spaniards, she became instrumental in the spanish conquest of mexico, acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to hernán cortés.
web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations.
meanwhile, in renaissance italy, a new period in the history of translation had opened in florence with the arrival, at the court of cosimo de' medici, of the byzantine scholar georgius gemistus pletho shortly before the fall of constantinople to the turks (1453).
translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called "singing translation"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most vocal music, at least in the western tradition, is set to verse, especially verse in regular patterns with rhyme. (
lasting effects on the religions, cultures and languages of their respective countries have been exerted by such bible translations as martin luther's into german, jakub wujek's into polish, and the king james bible's translators' into english.
for example, in the united kingdom the state-owned british airports authority originally operated eight of the nation's major commercial airports - it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the spanish ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just five.
landside areas include parking lots, public transportation train stations and access roads.
it is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems.
the hartsfield–jackson atlanta international airport has a tram that takes people through the concourses and baggage claim.
the title of "world's oldest airport" is disputed, but college park airport in maryland, us, established in 1909 by wilbur wright, is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continually operating airfield, although it serves only general aviation traffic.
the airports of this era used a paved "apron", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.
when a plane is ready to takeoff it will stop short of the runway, at which point it will be turned over to tower control.
in poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ils) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground.
for example, raf brize norton in the uk has a terminal which caters to passengers for the royal air force's scheduled tristar flights to the falkland islands.
however airside, filming is heavily restricted, the only airside locations where filming is permitted are the departure lounge and some outside areas.
according to the "normanist" view, the rus' were scandinavians, while russian and ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the rus' were themselves slavs.
on their way south, they discovered "a small city on a hill," kiev, captured it and the surrounding country from the khazars, populated the region with more varangians, and "established their dominion over the country of the polyanians."
rurik led the rus' until his death in about 879, bequeathing his kingdom to his kinsman, prince oleg, as regent for his young son, igor.
the new kievan state prospered due to its abundant supply of furs, beeswax, honey, and slaves for export, and because it controlled three main trade routes of eastern europe.
the byzantine empire was able to take advantage of the turmoil to expand its political influence and commercial relationships, first with the khazars and later with the rus' and other steppe groups.
the pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the rus' for agricultural goods and other products.
a sorcerer prophesies that the death of the grand prince would be associated with a certain horse.
oleg has the horse sequestered, and it later dies.
the emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the rus’, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the greek fire.
by the end of his short life, sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in europe, eventually moving his capital from kiev to pereyaslavets on the danube in 969.
the zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of vladimir the great (980–1015) and prince yaroslav i the wise (1019–1054).
a son of vladimir the great, he was vice-regent of novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015.
the last ruler to maintain united state was mstislav the great.
the crusades brought a shift in european trade routes that accelerated the decline of kievan rus'.
kievan rus', although sparsely populated compared to western europe, was not only the largest contemporary european state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.
from the 9th century, the pecheneg nomads began an uneasy relationship with kievan rus′. for over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into the lands of rus′, which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (such as the 920 war on the pechenegs by igor of kiev reported in the primary chronicle), but there were also temporary military alliances (e.g. the 943 byzantine campaign by igor).
in japan, the system is called the super famicom (japanese: スーパーファミコン, hepburn: sūpā famikon?,
game players were not the only ones to notice the violence in this game; us senators herb kohl and joe lieberman convened a congressional hearing on december 9, 1993 to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children.[e] while nintendo took the high ground with moderate success, the hearings led to the creation of the interactive digital software association and the entertainment software rating board, and the inclusion of ratings on all video games.
this can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot.
while the snes can address 128 mbit,[f] only 117.75 mbit are actually available for cartridge use.
the largest games released (tales of phantasia and star ocean) contain 48 mbit of rom data, while the smallest games contain only 2 mbit.
the standard snes controller adds two additional face buttons (x and y) to the design of the nes iteration, arranging the four in a diamond shape, and introduces two shoulder buttons.
many of these devices were modeled after earlier add-ons for the nes: the super scope is a light gun functionally similar to the nes zapper (though the super scope features wireless capabilities) and the super advantage is an arcade-style joystick with adjustable turbo settings akin to the nes advantage.
some of the more unusual controllers include the batterup baseball bat, the life fitness entertainment system (an exercise bike controller with built-in monitoring software), and the teev golf golf club.
ultimately, deals with both sony and philips fell through, (although a prototype console was produced by sony) with philips gaining the right to release a series of titles based on nintendo franchises for its cd-i multimedia player and sony going on to develop its own console based on its initial dealings with nintendo (the playstation).
in 2007, gametrailers named the snes as the second-best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that "left their mark on the history of gaming", citing its graphic, sound, and library of top-quality games.
native sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the neo-sumerian empire or third dynasty of ur (sumerian renaissance) approximately 2100-2000 bc, but the akkadian language also remained in use.
sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century bc and before, but the historical record remains obscure until the early dynastic iii period, c. the 23rd century bc, when a now deciphered syllabary writing system was developed, which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions.
although short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of eannatum of lagash, who annexed practically all of sumer, including kish, uruk, ur, and larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of umma, arch-rival of lagash.
his empire collapsed shortly after his death.
use of old akkadian was at its peak during the rule of sargon the great (c. 2270–2215 bc), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in sumerian, the language used by the scribes.
later, the 3rd dynasty of ur under ur-nammu and shulgi, whose power extended as far as southern assyria, was the last great "sumerian renaissance", but already the region was becoming more semitic than sumerian, with the rise in power of the akkadian speaking semites in assyria and elsewhere, and the influx of waves of semitic martu (amorites) who were to found several competing local powers including isin, larsa, eshnunna and eventually babylon.
it is speculated by some archaeologists that sumerian speakers were farmers who moved down from the north, after perfecting irrigation agriculture there.
the code of ur-nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the ur-iii "sumerian renaissance", reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late sumerian law.
beneath the lu-gal ("great man" or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: the "lu" or free person, and the slave (male, arad; female geme).

beer brewing was very important to the sumerians.
they built this by constructing and linking several arches.
according to hudson, the purpose of these decrees was to prevent debts mounting to a degree that they threatened fighting force which could happen if peasants lost the subsistence land or became bondservants due to the inability to repay the debt.
it shows the king of lagash leading a sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry.
they may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers.
in 1568, spanish navigator álvaro de mendaña was the first european to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of nui during his expedition in search of terra australis.
eight of the nine islands of tuvalu were inhabited; thus the name, tuvalu, means "eight standing together" in tuvaluan (compare to *walo meaning "eight" in proto-austronesian).
byron charted the atolls as lagoon islands.
keith s. chambers and doug munro (1980) identified niutao as the island that francisco mourelle de la rúa sailed past on 5 may 1781, thus solving what europeans had called the mystery of gran cocal.

the japanese had already occupied tarawa and other islands in what is now kiribati, but were delayed by the losses at the battle of the coral sea.
the tuvaluan government, the us government, and the governments of other pacific islands, are parties to the south pacific tuna treaty (sptt), which entered into force in 1988.
in july 2013 tuvalu signed the memorandum of understanding (mou) to establish the pacific regional trade and development facility, which facility originated in 2006, in the context of negotiations for an economic partnership agreement (epa) between pacific acp states and the european union.
tuvaluans can participate in the australian pacific seasonal worker program, which allows pacific islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the australian agriculture industry, in particular cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.
the language has borrowed from the samoan language, as a consequence of christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly samoan.
the princess margaret hospital on funafuti is the only hospital in tuvalu.
this program is required for tertiary education programmes outside of tuvalu and is available at the university of the south pacific (usp) extension centre in funafuti.

at the end of their studies the graduates can apply to continue studies either at motufoua secondary school or the tuvalu maritime training institute (tmti).
the ctcs offer training in basic carpentry, gardening and farming, sewing and cooking.
the artistic traditions of tuvalu have traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans.
the cuisine of tuvalu is based on the staple of coconut and the many species of fish found in the ocean and lagoons of the atolls.
desserts made on the islands include coconut and coconut milk, instead of animal milk.

the governments of australia and new zealand responded to the 2011 fresh-water crisis by supplying temporary desalination plants, and assisted in the repair of the existing desalination unit that was donated by japan in 2006.
aid programs from the european union and australia also provided water tanks as part of the longer term solution for the storage of available fresh water.
the coral bleaching, which includes staghorn corals, is attributed to the increase in water temperature that occurred during the el niños that occurred from 1998–2000 and from 2000–2001.
the project of the japan international cooperation agency is designed to increase the resilience of the tuvalu coast against sea level rise through ecosystem rehabilitation and regeneration and through support for sand production.
along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later, severe tropical cyclone ofa had a major impact on tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops.
nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (nui, nukufetau and vaitupu); with both nui and nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops.
in 1677, the holy see condemned the belief that mary was virginally conceived, which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century.
another misunderstanding is that, by her immaculate conception, mary did not need a saviour.
he stated that mary, rather than being cleansed after sin, was completely prevented from contracting original sin in view of the foreseen merits of jesus christ, the savior of the human race.
in other places sophronius explains that the theotokos was already immaculate, when she was "purified" at the annunciation and goes so far as to note that john the baptist is literally "holier than all 'men' born of woman" since mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even john after his sanctification in utero.
by 750, the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the byzantine east, under the name of the conception (active) of saint anne.
pope pius ix would later appoint spada master of the sacred palace in 1867.
by the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of thomas aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared "doctor angelicus" of the church in 1567) that the council of trent (1545–63)—which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position.
it said the fathers saw foreshadowings of mary's "wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence" "in that ark of noah, which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world; in the ladder which jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven, by whose rungs the angels of god ascended and descended, and on whose top the lord himself leaned; in that bush which moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides, which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully; in that impregnable tower before the enemy, from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong; in that garden enclosed on all sides, which cannot be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots; in that resplendent city of god, which has its foundations on the holy mountains; in that most august temple of god, which, radiant with divine splendours, is full of the glory of god; and in very many other biblical types of this kind."
all the same, the historical and authentic tradition of mariology in byzantium took its historical point of departure from sophronios, damascene, and their imitators.
martin luther, who initiated the protestant reformation, said: "mother mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the holy spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood.
others have rejected that the doctrine of immaculate conception exists in islam, the quranic account does not confirm the immaculate conception exclusively for mary as in islam every human child is born pure and immaculate, her sinless birth is thus independent of the christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in islam.
in volume 5 of his decline and fall of the roman empire, published in 1788, edward gibbon wrote: "the latin church has not disdained to borrow from the koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother."
in the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854, this charge was repeated: "strange as it may appear, that the doctrine which the church of rome has promulgated, with so much pomp and ceremony, 'for the destruction of all heresies, and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents', should have its origin in the mohametan bible; yet the testimony of such authorities as gibbon, and sale, and forster, and gagnier, and maracci, leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact."
most of the territory became a german imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a german colony until the end of world war i. in 1920, the league of nations mandated the country to south africa, which imposed its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy.
it recognised the south west africa people's organisation (swapo) as the official representative of the namibian people in 1973.
namibia obtained full independence from south africa in 1990, with the exception of walvis bay and the penguin islands, which remained under south african control until 1994.
the nama-herero war broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only when imperial germany deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo between nama, orlams, and herero.
following the league's replacement by the united nations in 1946, south africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a united nations trusteeship agreement, requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration (along with a definite independence schedule).
in response to the 1966 ruling by the international court of justice, south-west africa people's organisation (swapo) military wing, people's liberation army of namibia, a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence, but it was not until 1988 that south africa agreed to end its occupation of namibia, in accordance with a un peace plan for the entire region.
outside the central-southern area of namibia (known as the "police zone" since the german era and which contained the main towns, industries, mines and best arable land), the country was divided into "homelands", the version of south african bantustan applied to namibia, although only a few were actually established because indigenous namibians often did not cooperate.
a combined un civilian and peace-keeping force called untag (united nations transition assistance group) under finnish diplomat martti ahtisaari was deployed from april 1989 to march 1990 to monitor the peace process, elections and supervise military withdrawals.
the official election slogan was "free and fair elections".
namibia extends from 17°s to 25°s: climatically the range of the sub-tropical high pressure belt, arid is the overall climate description descending from the sub-humid (mean rain above 500 mm) through semi-arid between 300 and 500 mm (embracing most of the waterless kalahari) and arid from 150 to 300 mm (these three regions are inland from the western escarpment) to the hyper-arid coastal plain with less than a 100 mm mean.
typically the sub-tropical high pressure belt, with frequent clear skies, provides more than 300 days of sunshine per year.
the winter (june – august) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between september and november, the big one between february and april.
with an average rainfall of about 350 mm per annum, the highest rainfall occurs in the caprivi in the northeast (about 600 mm per annum) and decreases in a westerly and southwesterly direction to as little as 50 mm and less per annum at the coast.
strict unemployment" (people actively seeking a full-time job) stood at 20.2% in 2000, 21.9% in 2004 and spiraled to 29.4% in 2008.
providing 25% of namibia's revenue, mining is the single most important contributor to the economy.
namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in africa and the world's fourth largest producer of uranium.
many of namibia's inhabitants have to resort to "flying toilets", plastic bags to defecate which after use are flung into the bush.
the 1960 census reported 526,004 persons in what was then south-west africa, including 73,464 whites (14%).
consequently, swapo instituted english as the sole official language of namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language.

the women's inline hockey national team participated in the 2008 firs world championships.
the most famous athlete from namibia is frankie fredericks, sprinter (100 and 200 m).
the first newspaper in namibia was the german-language windhoeker anzeiger, founded 1898.
the first newspaper in namibia was the german-language windhoeker anzeiger, founded 1898.
research has shown that in namibia the risk of contracting malaria is 14.5% greater if a person is also infected with hiv.
stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically though an optional acute accent (знак ударения, znak udareniya) may be used to mark stress, such as to distinguish between homographic words, for example замо́к (zamok, meaning a lock) and за́мок (zamok, meaning a castle), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.

in many places in eastern and southern ukraine and throughout belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures, e.g. surzhyk in eastern ukraine and trasianka in belarus.
until the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects.
ethnic russians constitute 25.5% of the country's current population and 58.6% of the native estonian population is also able to speak russian.
according to estimates from demoskop weekly, in 2004 there were 14,400,000 native speakers of russian in the country, and 29 million active speakers.
in ukraine, russian is seen as a language of inter-ethnic communication, and a minority language, under the 1996 constitution of ukraine.
these have been fed by several waves of immigrants since the beginning of the 20th century, each with its own flavor of language.
this practice goes back to the apollo-soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.
others divide the language into three groupings, northern, central (or middle) and southern, with moscow lying in the central region.
in the 19th, vladimir dal compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary.
for example, мороз ('frost') is transliterated moroz, and мышь ('mouse'), mysh or myš'.
for example, мороз ('frost') is transliterated moroz, and мышь ('mouse'), mysh or myš'.
nevertheless, the spread of ms-dos and os/2 (ibm866), traditional macintosh (iso/iec 8859-5) and microsoft windows (cp1251) created chaos and ended by establishing different encodings as de facto standards, with windows-1251 becoming a de facto standard in russian internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995–2005.
while /k/, /ɡ/, /x/ do have palatalized allophones [kʲ, ɡʲ, xʲ], only /kʲ/ might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive (the only native minimal pair which argues for /kʲ/ to be a separate phoneme is "это ткёт" ([ˈɛtə tkʲɵt], 'it weaves')/"этот кот" ([ˈɛtət kot], 'this cat')).
following the break-up of the ussr in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of russian, though its role as the language of post-soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.
in 2012, a. l. arefyev published a new study "russian language at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries", in which he confirmed his conclusion about the trend of further weakening of the russian language in all regions of the world (findings published in 2013 in the journal "demoskop weekly").
the air force is headed by the civilian secretary of the air force, who reports to the secretary of defense, and is appointed by the president with senate confirmation.
the highest-ranking military officer in the department of the air force is the chief of staff of the air force, who exercises supervision over air force units, and serves as a member of the joint chiefs of staff.
assure/dissuade/deter is a mission set derived from the air force's readiness to carry out the nuclear strike operations mission as well as from specific actions taken to assure allies as a part of extended deterrence.
if a crisis occurs, rapid generation and, if necessary, deployment of nuclear strike capabilities will demonstrate us resolve and may prompt an adversary to alter the course of action deemed threatening to our national interest.
oca is the preferred method of countering air and missile threats, since it attempts to defeat the enemy closer to its source and typically enjoys the initiative.
space superiority provides freedom of action in space for friendly forces and, when directed, denies the same freedom to the adversary.
this mission area includes: operations conducted to protect friendly space capabilities from attack, interference, or unintentional hazards (defensive space control); operations to deny an adversary's use of space capabilities (offensive space control); and the requisite current and predictive knowledge of the space environment and the operational environment upon which space operations depend (space situational awareness)" (jp 1-02).
cyberspace defense incorporates cne, computer network defense (cnd), and cna techniques and may be a contributor to influence operations.
planning and directing is "the determination of intelligence requirements, development of appropriate intelligence architecture, preparation of a collection plan, and issuance of orders and requests to information collection agencies" (jp 2-01, joint and national intelligence support to military operations).
jp 4-02, health service support, further defines it as "the fixed wing movement of regulated casualties to and between medical treatment facilities, using organic and/or contracted mobility airframes, with aircrew trained explicitly for this mission."
building partnerships is described as airmen interacting with international airmen and other relevant actors to develop, guide, and sustain relationships for mutual benefit and security.
prior to 1947, the responsibility for military aviation was shared between the army (for land-based operations), the navy (for sea-based operations from aircraft carriers and amphibious aircraft), and the marine corps (for close air support of infantry operations).
however, the reduction was ended at approximately 330,000 personnel in 2008 in order to meet the demand signal of combatant commanders and associated mission requirements.
specific concerns include a compounded inability for the air force to replace its aging fleet, and an overall reduction of strength and readiness.
enlisted promotions are granted based on a combination of test scores, years of experience, and selection board approval while officer promotions are based on time-in-grade and a promotion selection board.
this process will repeat at the 16 year mark (for officers previously promoted early to major and lieutenant colonel) to the 21 year mark for promotion to full colonel.
although provision is made in title 10 of the united states code for the secretary of the air force to appoint warrant officers, the air force does not currently use warrant officer grades, and is the only one of the u.s. armed services not to do so.
the current service dress uniform, which was adopted in 1993 and standardized in 1995, consists of a three-button, pocketless coat, similar to that of a men's "sport jacket" (with silver "u.s." pins on the lapels, with a silver ring surrounding on those of enlisted members), matching trousers, and either a service cap or flight cap, all in shade 1620, "air force blue" (a darker purplish-blue).
the proximity to friendly forces require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible with bomber aircraft listed below.
the workhorses of the usaf air mobility command are the c-130 hercules, c-17 globemaster iii, and c-5 galaxy.
the purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent an advantage in the ems and ensure friendly, unimpeded access to the em spectrum portion of the information environment.
many of these fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are dual-roled as fighter-bombers (e.g., the f-16 fighting falcon); the term "fighter" is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft.
air-to-air refueling is extensively used in large-scale operations and also used in normal operations; fighters, bombers, and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the lesser-known "tanker" aircraft.
in response to the 2007 united states air force nuclear weapons incident, secretary of defense robert gates accepted in june 2009 the resignations of secretary of the air force michael wynne and the chief of staff of the air force general t. michael moseley.
daniel l. magruder, jr defines usaf culture as a combination of the rigorous application of advanced technology, individualism and progressive airpower theory.
for many years, the u.s. air force used "aim high" as its recruiting slogan; more recently, they have used "cross into the blue", "we've been waiting for you" and "do something amazing", "above all", and the newest one, as of 7 october 2010, considered a call and response, "aim high" followed with the response, "fly-fight-win" each wing, group, or squadron usually has its own slogan(s).
light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, camera flashes and lighted wallpaper.
the attainment of high efficiency in blue leds was quickly followed by the development of the first white led.
to quantitatively classify useful lifetime in a standardized manner it has been suggested to use l70 or l50, which are the runtimes (typically given in thousands of hours) at which a given led reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively.
in 2015, a us court ruled that three companies (i.e. the litigants who had not previously settled out of court) that had licensed mr. nakamura's patents for production in the united states had infringed dr. moustakas's prior patent, and order them to pay licensing fees of not less than 13 million usd.
as the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of dna, with a peak at about 260 nm, uv led emitting at 250–270 nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices.
hence the method is called multi-color white leds (sometimes referred to as rgb leds).
trichromatic white leds are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (>70 lm/w) and fair color rendering capability.
their luminous efficacies compared to normal leds depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the led itself.
for instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor.
a concern is that uv light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin.
it is predicted that by 2020, 40% of all gan leds will be made with gan-on-si.
this allows quantum dot leds to create almost any color on the cie diagram.
they are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for christmas and led matrices.
in a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the leds are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a phantom array, where ghost images of the led will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array.
light-emitting diodes (as well as semiconductor lasers) are used to send data over many types of fiber optic cable, from digital audio over toslink cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the internet backbone.
this includes remote controls, such as for tvs, vcrs, and led computers, where infrared leds are often used.
although led forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a zener diode, zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 v are not widely available.
great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own.
at the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the g7 which consists of canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom and the united states of america.
this is a crucial factor in distinguishing a great power from a regional power; by definition the scope of a regional power is restricted to its region.
this unique period of american primacy has been an important factor in maintaining a condition of peace between the great powers.
these five nations are the only states to have permanent seats with veto power on the un security council.
birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich.
the fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs.
aves and a sister group, the clade crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade archosauria.
recent discoveries in the liaoning province of northeast china, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.
these features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or "hind wings" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.
the first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the enantiornithes, or "opposite birds", so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds.
the first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the enantiornithes, or "opposite birds", so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds.
all modern birds lie within the crown group aves (alternately neornithes), which has two subdivisions: the palaeognathae, which includes the flightless ratites (such as the ostriches) and the weak-flying tinamous, and the extremely diverse neognathae, containing all other birds.
the skeleton consists of very lightweight bones.
birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste.
the nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.
birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.
feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.
birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.
these are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.
many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.
most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song.
the chicks of the synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.
in general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.
for example, in new zealand the moas were important browsers, as are the kereru and kokako today.
birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes.
birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology.
among the most famous of these bird artists was john james audubon, whose paintings of north american birds were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national audubon society.
many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by birdlife international and the iucn in 2009.
over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of melanesian, polynesian, and micronesian islands.
the dynasty was founded by the jurchen aisin gioro clan in manchuria.
local uprisings starting on october 11, 1911 led to the xinhai revolution.
the qing dynasty was founded not by han chinese, who constitute the majority of the chinese population, but by a sedentary farming people known as the jurchen, a tungusic people who lived around the region now comprising the chinese provinces of jilin and heilongjiang.
the newly allied armies captured beijing on june 6.
the three liaodong han bannermen officers who played a massive role in the conquest of southern china from the ming were shang kexi, geng zhongming, and kong youde and they governed southern china autonomously as viceroys for the qing after their conquests.
under the ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of a top-knot.
the manchus sent han bannermen to fight against koxinga's ming loyalists in fujian.
finally, in 1673, shang kexi petitioned kangxi for permission to retire to his hometown in liaodong province and nominated his son as his successor.
the move backfired as the young emperor called their bluff by accepting their requests and ordering that all three fiefdoms to be reverted to the crown.

the winemaking putti in the ambulatory of santa constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of bacchus, which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building.

the creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines.
the priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes.
as a result of the punic wars (264–146 bc), when rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.
some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported vestals, who tended rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under christian domination.
the impressive, costly, and centralised rites to the deities of the roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual's domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of rome's various neighborhoods and communities, and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful roman religion.
the roman architect vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct, and the more common latin words aedes, delubrum, or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building.
all sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective.
di superi with strong connections to the earth, such as mars, janus, neptune and various genii – including the emperor's – were offered fertile victims.
animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as "the living cannot share a meal with the dead".
political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice, whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses; marcus marius gratidianus was a gruesome example.
proper, respectful religio brought social harmony and prosperity.
priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional roman practice, a priest drew no stipend.
for the less well-off, inhumation with "a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient".
a senior magistrate-commander (sometimes even a consul) headed it, his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty.
by the early severan era, the military also offered cult to the imperial divi, the current emperor's numen, genius and domus (or familia), and special cult to the empress as "mother of the camp."
he was defeated, and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator, he appointed his messenger glycias, as if again making a jest of his country's peril."
secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect.
approximately half rome's population were slave or free non-citizens.
where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; liber's festival continued.
the city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours; according to tradition, rome's etruscan connections established a temple to minerva on the predominantly plebeian aventine; she became part of a new capitoline triad of jupiter, juno and minerva, installed in a capitoline temple, built in an etruscan style and dedicated in a new september festival, epulum jovis.
in 206 bc the sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic magna mater (great mother) from pessinus, installed on the palatine in 191 bc.
the mystery cult to bacchus followed; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the senate in 186 bc.
in rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional.
their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by julius caesar.
valerian's first religious edict singled out christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult, outlawed its assemblies and urged christians to sacrifice to rome's traditional gods.
in some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced: some christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred.
the solution came from a hitherto unlikely source: as pontifex maximus constantine i favoured the "catholic church of the christians" against the donatists because:
constantine called all the christian bishops throughout the roman empire to a meeting, and some 318 bishops (very few from the western empire) attended the first council of nicaea.
pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator symmachus (d. 402) were rejected.
yet theodosius accepted comparison with hercules and jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly hellenic senate in traditional hellenic terms.[clarification needed] he was the last emperor of both east and west.

youtube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a dmca takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the online copyright infringement liability limitation act.
youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.
most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content.

j. brent walker, executive director of the baptist joint committee, responded to hamburger's claims noting; "the fact that the separation of church and state has been supported by some who exhibited an anti-catholic animus or a secularist bent does not impugn the validity of the principle.
religious freedom resulted from an alliance of unlikely partners," writes the historian frank lambert in his book the founding fathers and the place of religion in america. "
the answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension."

it traces its roots back to the puritans in england, where evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the united states.
because sola scriptura placed the bible as the only source of teaching, sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to, namely the direct, close, personal connection between christ and the believer, hence the reformers' contention that their work was christocentric.
one of the central points of divergence was controversy over the eucharist.
early protestants rejected the roman catholic dogma of transubstantiation, which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of christ.

the second great awakening in the south in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings.

additionally, there are also many smaller bodies such as the international lutheran council and the confessional evangelical lutheran conference, as well as independent churches.
soteriologically, most methodists are arminian, emphasizing that christ accomplished salvation for every human being, and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it (as opposed to the traditional calvinist doctrine of monergism).

the view of the roman catholic church is that protestant denominations cannot be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the catholic sacraments and dogmas, and the protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession.

the name 'brasília' is commonly used as a synonym for the federal district through synecdoche; however, the federal district is composed of 31 administrative regions, only one of which is brasília proper, with a population of 209,926 in a 2011 survey; demographic publications generally do not make this distinction and list the population of brasília as synonymous with the population of the federal district, considering the whole of it as its metropolitan area.
with the constitution of 1988 brasília gained the right to elect its governor, and a district assembly (câmara legislativa) was elected to exercise legislative power.

if the minority leader's party takes control of the house, and the party officers are all re-elected to their seats, the minority leader is usually the party's top choice for speaker for the next congress, while the minority whip is typically in line to become majority leader.
the current minority leader nancy pelosi, of the united states house of representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is the counterpart to the majority leader.
traditionally, the speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the house, with the majority leader as second-in-command.
a minority leader from 1931 to 1939, representative bertrand snell, r-n.y., provided this "job description": "he is spokesman for his party and enunciates its policies.
the style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements, including personality and contextual factors, such as the size and cohesion of the minority party, whether his or her party controls the white house, the general political climate in the house, and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda.
he or she is a member of the democratic congressional campaign committee; names the members of the democratic leadership council; chairs the policy committee; and heads the steering committee.
he or she is a member of the democratic congressional campaign committee; names the members of the democratic leadership council; chairs the policy committee; and heads the steering committee.
for instance, a majority party riven by internal dissension, as occurred during the early 1900s when progressive and "regular" republicans were at loggerheads, may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion.
to be sure, the minority leader recognizes that "going negative" carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public.
minority leaders also make floor speeches and close debate on major issues before the house; they deliver addresses in diverse forums across the country; and they write books or articles that highlight minority party goals and achievements.
the chief deputy whip is the primary assistant to the whip, who is the chief vote counter for his or her party.
in greek, αρμένιοι "armenians" is attested from about the same time, perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to hecataeus of miletus (476 bc).
soon after hayasa-azzi were arme-shupria (1300s–1190 bc), the nairi (1400–1000 bc) and the kingdom of urartu (860–590 bc), who successively established their sovereignty over the armenian highland.
in hamp's view the homeland of this subgroup is the northeast coast of the black sea and its hinterlands.
the first geographical entity that was called armenia by neighboring peoples (such as by hecataeus of miletus and on the achaemenid behistun inscription) was established in the late 6th century bc under the orontid dynasty within the achaemenid persian empire as part of the latters' territories, and which later became a kingdom.

in 1932, rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938, introduced what he called a "theocratic" (literally, god-ruled) organizational system, under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the brooklyn headquarters.
in a major organizational overhaul in 1976, the power of the watch tower society president was diminished, with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the governing body.
the organization is led by the governing body—an all-male group that varies in size, but since early 2014 has comprised seven members,[note 1] all of whom profess to be of the "anointed" class with a hope of heavenly life—based in the watch tower society's brooklyn headquarters.
new elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders.
individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them "as one of jehovah's witnesses in association with god's spirit-directed organization," though witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to god and not "to a man, work or organization."
the governing body does not issue any single, comprehensive "statement of faith", but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways through publications published by the watch tower society.
the entire protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired, inerrant word of god.
jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between god and humanity, and appointed by god as the king and judge of his kingdom.
jehovah's witnesses teach that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving armageddon, but that god is the final judge.
jehovah's witnesses believe that god's kingdom is a literal government in heaven, ruled by jesus christ and 144,000 "spirit-anointed" christians drawn from the earth, which they associate with jesus' reference to a "new covenant".
they believe jesus' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914, and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth.
they remain politically neutral, do not seek public office, and are discouraged from voting, though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues.
the watch tower society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components, in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept.
in the study, jehovah's witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics.
although the general public and many bible scholars assume that the differences in the new world translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators, beduhn stated: “most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the nw as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the new testament writers.”
the watch tower society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet, stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible, and that it has not claimed its predictions were "the words of jehovah."
anderson says the policies "protect pedophiles rather than protect the children."
the religion's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized.

at the geneva conference eisenhower presented a proposal called "open skies" to facilitate disarmament, which included plans for russia and the u.s. to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure.
on the whole, eisenhower's support of the nation's fledgling space program was officially modest until the soviet launch of sputnik in 1957, gaining the cold war enemy enormous prestige around the world.
chief of staff matthew ridgway dissuaded the president from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary.

the active phase of the crisis, which manifested as a liquidity crisis, can be dated from august 9, 2007, when bnp paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing "a complete evaporation of liquidity".
while the housing and credit bubbles were building, a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile, a process called financialization.
these losses impacted the ability of financial institutions to lend, slowing economic activity.
in the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises (gses) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003.
although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis, they contend that gse loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks, and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios.

with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including fico scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks).
several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.

after defeating the visigoths in only a few months, the umayyad caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula.
beginning in 711, the land that is now portugal became part of the vast umayyad caliphate's empire of damascus, which stretched from the indus river in the indian sub-continent (now pakistan) up to the south of france, until its collapse in 750.
after almost two centuries, the emirate became the caliphate of córdoba in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called taifa kingdoms.
the governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves emir of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the christian kingdoms of the north.
most of portugal fell into the hands of the taifa of badajoz of the aftasid dynasty, and after a short spell of an ephemeral taifa of lisbon in 1022, fell under the dominion of the taifa of seville of the abbadids poets.
in the process, after defeating the moors in the battle of covadonga in 722 ad, pelayos was proclaimed king, thus founding the christian kingdom of asturias and starting the war of christian reconquest known in portuguese as the reconquista cristã.

humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over acceptance of dogma or superstition.
during the french revolution, and soon after, in germany (by the left hegelians), humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the transcendent or supernatural.
at about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in germany by the so-called left hegelians, arnold ruge, and karl marx, who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive german government.
the humanists' close study of latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods.
after the reformation, critical examination of the bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called higher criticism of the 19th-century german tübingen school.
two hundred years later seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:
comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular religion of humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated catholicism.
although comte's english followers, like eliot and martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity.
bragg asked roy wood sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the humanist manifesto in 1933.
there were important centres of humanism at florence, naples, rome, venice, mantua, ferrara, and urbino.
though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history.
the second is philosophical, german, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation.
the earth of the early archean (4,000 to 2,500 million years ago) may have had a different tectonic style.
the high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin.
in contrast to the deep-water deposits of the archean, the proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.
study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid continental accretion (unique to the proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and wholly modern orogenic activity.
the paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago (ma) and is subdivided into six geologic periods; from oldest to youngest they are the cambrian, ordovician, silurian, devonian, carboniferous and permian.
the cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 ma.
the ordovician period started at a major extinction event called the cambrian-ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 ma.
the ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.
a global drop in sea level at the end of the devonian reversed early in the carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the mississippian.
there were two major oceans in the carboniferous the panthalassa and paleo-tethys.
the last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago.
ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres (115 ft) in the early part of the holocene.
ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres (115 ft) in the early part of the holocene.
police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.
another organisation, the constabulary (french: connétablie), was under the command of the constable of france.
the word, and the concept of police itself, were "disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression" (according to britannica 1911).
in 1797, patrick colquhoun was able to persuade the west indies merchants who operated at the pool of london on the river thames, to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo.
moreover, he went so far as to praise the french system, which had reached "the greatest degree of perfection" in his estimation.
unlike the stipendiary system at bow street, the river police were full-time, salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees.
meanwhile, the authorities in glasgow, scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the glasgow police act establishing the city of glasgow police in 1800.
peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession, to organise it in a civilian fashion, and to make it answerable to the public.
the 1829 metropolitan police act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers, and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system.
it was followed in 1834 by the toronto police, and in 1838 by police forces in montreal and quebec city.
in the american old west, policing was often of very poor quality.[citation needed] the army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organized posses.[citation needed] public organizations were supplemented by private contractors, notably the pinkerton national detective agency, which was hired by individuals, businessmen, local governments and the federal government.
michel foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by german and french legal scholars and practitioners in public administration and statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries, most notably with nicolas delamare's traité de la police ("treatise on the police"), first published in 1705.
edwin chadwick's 1829 article, "preventive police" in the london review, argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice.
a "shoot-to-kill" policy was recently introduced in south africa, which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians.
in recent years, vehicle-installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications, enabling easier dispatching of calls, criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds, and updating officers' daily activity log and other, required reports on a real-time basis.
this practice is controversial, with for example, new york state banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers.
the study of genocide has mainly been focused towards the legal aspect of the term.
in 1946, the first session of the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution that "affirmed" that genocide was a crime under international law, but did not provide a legal definition of the crime.
in 1948, the un general assembly adopted the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (cppcg) which defined the crime of genocide for the first time.
the appeals chamber goes into details of other cases and the opinions of respected commentators on the genocide convention to explain how they came to this conclusion.
in paragraph 13 the judges raise the issue of the perpetrators' access to the victims: "the historical examples of genocide also suggest that the area of the perpetrators’ activity and control, as well as the possible extent of their reach, should be considered. ...
writing in 1998 kurt jonassohn and karin björnson stated that the cppcg was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise.
jonassohn and björnson postulate that the major reason why no single generally accepted genocide definition has emerged is because academics have adjusted their focus to emphasise different periods and have found it expedient to use slightly different definitions to help them interpret events.
the exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the cppcg legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists, for example m. hassan kakar in his book the soviet invasion and the afghan response, 1979–1982 argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted, and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator and quotes chalk and jonassohn: "genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group, as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator."
in genocides, the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics, i.e., ethnicity, religion or nationality.
daniel d. polsby and don b. kates, jr. state that "... we follow harff's distinction between genocides and 'pogroms,' which she describes as 'short-lived outbursts by mobs, which, although often condoned by authorities, rarely persist.'
all signatories to the cppcg are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide, both in peace and wartime, though some barriers make this enforcement difficult.
all signatories to the cppcg are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide, both in peace and wartime, though some barriers make this enforcement difficult.
because the universal acceptance of international laws which in 1948 defined and forbade genocide with the promulgation of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (cppcg), those criminals who were prosecuted after the war in international courts for taking part in the holocaust were found guilty of crimes against humanity and other more specific crimes like murder.
on 21 july 2008, karadžić was arrested in belgrade, and he is currently in the hague on trial accused of genocide among other crimes.
two permanent members of the security council, the united states and china, abstained from the vote on the referral resolution.
other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide.
