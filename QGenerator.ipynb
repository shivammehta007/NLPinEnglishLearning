As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be <unk> in that it is clear and <unk> and its legal implications <unk> specially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly <unk> by those who are subject to the law. In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits <unk> post facto laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published.

In <unk> and <unk> two <unk> claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling <unk> beer under wholesale price, was <unk> The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in <unk> it was an equally applicable <unk> <unk> (not something that <unk> a <unk> <unk> it was outside the scope of article <unk> and so did not need to be <unk> <unk> arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in <unk> particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and <unk> In <unk> v De <unk> the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained <unk> under article 36 or as a mandatory <unk> the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling <unk> <unk> to <unk> the market. In <unk> v <unk> <unk> the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for <unk> to overcome <unk> \"traditional social practices and to local habits and <unk> to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the <unk> Commercial Practices <unk> the EU <unk> restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as <unk> Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to <unk> minimum ideals of best practice.
